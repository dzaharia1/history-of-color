The Poem of the Cid

With tearful eyes he turned to gaze upon the wreck behind :
His rifled coffers, bursten gates, all open to the wind :
Nor mantle left, nor robe of fur ; stript bare his castle hall :
Nor hawk nor falcon in the mew, the perches empty all.
Then forth in sorrow went my Cid, and a deep sigh

sighed he ;
Yet with a measured voice, and calm, my Cid spake loftily â€”
' I thank thee God our Father, thou that dwellest upon high,
I suffer cruel wrong to-day, but of mine enemy.'
As they came riding from Bivar ' the crow was on the right.
By Burgos gate, upon the left, the crow was there in sight.^
My Cid he shrugged his shoulders and he lifted up his

â–  head :
' Good tidings ! Alvar Fanez ; ^ we are banished men ! ' he

said.

' Bivar, now a small hamlet about three miles to the north of Burgos,
on the Santander road. A few stones near the river are said to mark
the site of the Cid's castle.

2 The Cid's belief in augury is more than once alluded to in the
poem, and he is taunted with it in a letter from the Count of Barcelona
quoted in the Gesta. It seems, however, to have been common in
Spain at the time, for in the Cento Nmelle Antic}ie Messer Imberal del
Balzo is described as much given to augury ' a guisa spagnuola.'

64 THE CID.

With sixty lances in his train my Cid rode up the town,
The burghers and their dames from all the windows looking

down ;
And there were tears in every eye, and on each lip one

word :
-^ ' A worthy vassal â€” would to God he served a worthy lord ! '
Fain would they shelter him, but none durst yield to his

desire.
Great was the fear through Burgos town of King Alfonso's

ire.
Sealed with his royal seal hath come his letter to forbid
All men to offer harbourage or succour to my Cid.
And he that dared to disobey, well did he know the cost â€”
\ His goods,, his eyes, stood forfeited, his soul and body lost.
A hard and grievous word was that to men of Christian

race;
And, since â–  they might not greet my Cid, they hid them

from his face.
He rode to his own mansion gates;* shut firm and fast they

were,
Such the king's rigour, save by force, he might not enter

there ;
And loudly though his henchmen call, within no sound is

heard.
No answer to their call; my Cid up to the threshold spurred,

news. Alvar Fanez (or Fernandez), son of Fernan Lainez, was the
Cid's cousin, and next to him the most distinguished warrior of the
time in Moorish warfare ; and as such is celjbrated in the old poem on
the taking of Almeria.

â– â–  The Cid's town house (su posada) was in the Calle Alta near the
Arco de San Martin. The site is marked by three pillars of modern
date.



THE CID. 65

His foot from out the stirrup raised and on the door smote
hard :

It yielded not beneath the stroke,- 'twas stout and strongly-
barred :

But from a chamber window high a damsel's voice im-
plored :

' O thou that in a happy hour didst gird thee with the sword,

It is the order of the king ; we dare not, O my lord !

Sealed with his royal seal hath come his letter to forbid

The Burgos folk to open door, or shelter thee, my Cid.

Our goods, our homes, our very eyes, in this are all at stake ;

And small the gain to thee, though we meet ruin for thy
sake.

Go, and God prosper thee in all that thou dost undertake.'

So spake the little damsel, and she hurried from the place.

Then knew my Cid no hope was left of King Alfonso's
grace.

And turning away he spurred on through Burgos to Santa
Maria, and passing through the gate he halted beside the
Arlanzon, and my Cid Ruy Diaz, he who g^rt_oii_the- sword- in -a
good hour, with a goodly company around him, pft3iea"Tiis~teht
there in the Glera,^ as if he were on a mountain-side, since there
was no house open to him. Moreover, he was forbidden to buy
food of any sort in Burgos, nor durst any man sell him a
farthing's-worth. But Martin Antolinez, the worthy Burgalese,
brought them bread and wine of his own, and my Cid and his
men were refreshed. And said Martin Antolinez, ' Campeador,
bom in a good hour, we must go forth this night, for I shall be
held to account, and earn the wrath of King Alfonso, because I
have served you. But if I escape safe with you, sooner or later
the king will be glad to have me for a friend ; if not, I care not

which the Arlanzon river flows.

a fig for what I leave behind.' Said my Cid, ' Martin Antolinez,
a stout lance art thou ; if I live I will repay thee double ; but
my gold and silver are spent ; money have I none, and I need
it for my troop, and have it I must ; for nothing is obtained for
nothing. With your help I will make two chests, and we will
fill them with sand, so that they be heavy, and they shall be
covered with red leather and studded with gilt nails,' and thou
shalt go to Rachel and Vidas, and say that I cannot carry with
me my treasure, for it is very weighty, and that I would paVn it
for what may be reasonable. I call God and all his Saints to
witness, that I cannot help this, and do it against my will.' And
Martin Antolinez without delay passed through Burgos and
entered the castle and sought out Rachel and Vidas. And
Rachel and Vidas were together, couiiting their wealth ^nd
profits. In friendly fashion Martin Antolinez came tcr them :
' Rachel and Vidas, my dear friends, give me your hands that
ye will not discover me to Christian or to Moor. I am come to
make you rich for ever with no risk of loss. The Campeador
has levied much tribute, and has carried away great and rich
treasure, on account of which be has been accused. He has
two chests full of fine gold. These he cannot carry with him
unseen, and h^ would leave them in your hands if ye will lend
him what money may be reasonable, and put the cheists in your
plade of safety,'' swearing and pledging yourselves both that ye
will not look into them for this year to come.' Rachel and
Vidas consulted together. 'We must seek profit by every
means. We know well he has wealth : what rich ti-easure he
took when he entered the lands of the Moors. He who has
money sleeps not without care. We will take these chests and
put them where they shall not be seen ; but tell us what will
content the Cid, and what interest will he give us for the year?'
Said Martin Aiitolinez in friendly fashion, 'My Cid desires
what is reasonable, and asks little for leaving his treasure in
your hands. Needy men are gathering to him from all sides.

" One of these chests, long since stripped of its red leather and gilt
nails, is still seen, or, to use a safer word, shown, in the sacristy of
. Burgos Cathedral.

' Literally, 'in your safe' â€” 'en vuestro salvo,'

He requires six hundred marks.' Said Rachel and Vidas, 'We
will give them willingly.' Said Martin, ' Night is coming on,
and my Cid is pressed : we would that ye give us the marks.'
' But,' said Rachel and Vidas, 'â–  business is not done thus ; but
by first taking and then giving.' ' Good,' said Martin Antolinez,
'let us all three to the Campeador, and we will help you to carry
the chests and put them in your place of safety, so that neither
Moor nor Christian may know.' With that they betook them-
selves to the tent of the Campeador, and they kissed his hands,
and my Cid said smiling, ' Don Rachel and Vidas, ye have
forgotten me. I am .exiled now, and under the wrath of the
king, but ye will have somewhat of my substance, and while ye
live ye shall never suffer loss.' Then Martin Antolmez set forth
the agreement that they should give him six hundred marks on
those chests, and keep them safely till the end of the year, and
pledge themselves by oath not to look into them meanwhile ;
else that they should be forsworn, and that my Cid should not
â– give them a farthing of the interest. Then said Martin Anto-
linez, ' Take up the chests and carry them away, and I will go
with you to bring back the marks, for my Cid has to march
before the cock crows.' You might see how glad they were
when they came to move the chests. They were not able to
hoist them on their shoulders, strong as they were. And in the
palace they spread a carpet, and over it a sheet of white linen,
whereon they paid down three hundred marks in silver and
other three hundred in gold. And Don Martin counted them,
taking them without weighing, and with them he loaded five
squires he had with him. This done, he said, ' Now, Don
Rachel and^Vidas, that the chests are in your hands, I who have
brought you this gain have fairly earned breeches.' And Rachel
and Vidas said between themselves, ' Let us give him a good
gift, for it was he who sought us out.' ' You deserve something,'
they said, ' and we will give you wherewithal you may get
breeches and a fur robe and a fair mantle ; we will give you
thirty marks ; you have earned them, and it is reasonable, and you
will testify to what we have agreed.' Don Martin received the
marks with thanks and took his leave, glad ' to quit the house ;
and passed through Burgos and across the Arlanzon, and came
to the tent of the Cid, who received hitn with open arms.

' Campeador,' he said, ' I bring good tidings. You have gained
six hundred marks and I thirty. Now bid them strike the tents
and let us go at once. At San Pedro de Cardeiia ' ere the cock
crow we shall see your high-born lady, and we will take rest and
then quit the' kingdom, for the day of grace draws to a close.'
With that the tents were struck, and my Cid and his band
mounted and rode forth. fWhen the good Campeador reached
San Pedro, the Abbot Don Sancho was chanting matins at day-
break, and Dona Ximena and her five ladies were praying to St.
Peter and the Creator to aid my Cid the Campeador. With
great joy they received him of the good hour, and said the Cid,
' Sir Abbot, as I am going forth from the land, I give you fifty
marks, and if I live they shall be doubled. I do not wish to
cause expense to the monastery. And here for Dona Ximena I
give you a hundred marks, that you maintain her and her
daughters and ladies for this year ; and if this should not suffice,
let them want for nothing, I charge you. For one mark that you
spend I will give four to the monastery.' Ximena sank on her
knees, weeping, and kissing his hands. ' Campeador, born in a
good hour, by wicked tale-bearers art thou driven from the land.
For the love of the blessed Mary give us counsel.' And he took
his daughters in his arms. ' Ximena,' said he, ' wife whom I love
as my soul, I have to go, and ye must remain behind ; but please
God and the blessed Mary I shall yet bestow these my
daughters in marriage, if fortune does not desert me, and some
days of life are left to me.' Meanwhile, through Castile it was
noised abroad that my Cid the Campeador was quitting the land.
And some left houses and others honours, and that day on the
bridge of Arlanzon a hundred and fifteen cavaUers assembled,
sasking for my Cid. Martin Antolinez joined them, and they
weiitto San Pedro. And when my Cid was aware of ityhe rode
forth to meet them, and said : ' I pray God that to you, who have
left houses and heritages for me, I may be able to restore
doubled what you have lost, fro-morrow, when the cocks crow,
the good Abbot will ring to matins in San Pfedro, and, mass said,

' The monastery of San Pedro de CardeSa stands about six miles
south-east of Burgos. It contains the tomb, but not the bones, of the
Cid and Ximena.



THE CID. 69

we will mount ; for the day of grace is nearly at an end, and we
have far to go.' The night passed and morning came, and with
the first cocks they prepared to mount, while the bells were
ringing to matins. And my Cid and his wife entered the church, J
and Ximena threw herself on the steps before the altar, praying /
fervently to God to protect my Cid Campeador from evil. j

The prayer was said, the mass was sung, they mounted to

depart ;
My Cid a moment stayed to press Ximena to his heart :
Ximena kissed his hand, as one distraught with grief was

she :
He looked upon his daughters : ' These to God I leave,'

said he ;
' Unto our Lady and to God, Father of all below ;
He knows if we shall meet again : â€” and now, sirs, let us go.'
As when the finger-nail from out the flesh is torn away.
Even so sharp to him and them the parting pang that day.
Then to his saddle sprang my Cid, and forth his vassals led ;
But ever as he rode, to those behind he turned his head.
Minaya with small favpur this so tender yearning viewed.
'Thou in the good hour bom!' he cried, 'where is thy

fortitude ?
Our thoughts should now be for our road, and thine are

wandering ;
Out of this sorrow of to-day to-morrow joy will spring.
â– God who hath given souls to us will give us guidance too.'
To Abbot Sancho then they turn, and charge him to be true,
And serve Ximena loyally and her young daughters twain,
Themselves and all their following, the ladies of their train.
And well the Abbot knew the charge would bring his house

much gain.

' Should any come to join our band, if to-our trail they holdj

They'll find us,' said Minaya, ' in the waste or on the wold.'

, ^^^th that they give their steeds the rein and on their way

they ride ;
The day of grace is well-nigh sped ; no longer may they

bide.
And thus an exile from the land the.loyal Champion went :
Over against Spinar de Can ^ that night he pitched his tent :
The good town San Est^ban ' next upon the left they sight :
The Moorish towers of Ahilon ^ rise far upon their right :
Then quitting Alcobilla, of Castilian towns the last,
And the highway of Quinea, they on rafts ^ the Duero

passed.

At Higeruela my Cid halted, while men came to him from
all sides. And as he laid him down after supper a sweet vision
visited him in his sleep. The angel Gabriel came to him in a.
dream, saying, ' Mount, Cid, brave Campeador. Never mounted
knight in so good a case : whilst thou livest thou shalt prosper.'

The next day â€” it was the last of the day of grace â€” they halted
at the Sierra de Miedes,^ and there the Campeador mustered his
men, and besides men on foot he counted three hundred pennoned
lances. By night they crossed the Sierra and went down the
Loma and descended upon Castejon oh the Henares. And my

' Spinar de Can â€” probably now Espinosa.

' San Esteban de Gormaz and Alcubilla, towns on the right bank
of the Duero.

' Ahilon â€” now Ayllon.

' 'On rafts' â€” ' sobre navas de palos. ' But near this spot is a place
called ' Navapalos ' on Coello's map, which may be a reminiscence of
the Cid's passage of the river at this point ; or, on the other hand, may
be the name of a place where even in the Cid's time there was a rude
raft ferry. '

THE OID. 71

Cid, by the advice of Alvar Fanez, placed himself in ambush with
a hundred of his company, while he despatched Alvar Fanez,
and Alvar Alvarez, and Alvar Salvadores, and Galin Garcia, with
two hundred, on a foray towards Hita and Guadalajara as far as
Alcald.' Dawn broke and the sun rose â€” God ! how splendid he
showedJ;::rAnd the men of Castejon aroie^ and opened their

""gatesTand sallied forth to their labours and their fields, leaving
the gates open and but few people in Castejon. Then the
Campeador issued from the ambush and rushed upon Castejon.
And those that held the gate were panic-stricken and left it un-
defended, andfeujrjjiazjentered by the gate with naked sword fy-,
in hand, and slew eleven of those he encountered, and worr^J^
Castejon with its gold and silver. The fifth part of the spoil
fell to my Cid, but it could not be sold here, nor did he care to
have captive men or women in his company. So he spoke
with those of Castejon, and he sent to Hita and Guadalajara
to know for how much this fifth part would be bought. And the
Moors appraised it at three thousand marks of silver. And my

'Cid was pleased with the offer, and on the third day the money
was paid. And my Cid agreed with his company not to remain
in the castle, as King Alfonso was near ; and they departed ricTi
from the castle they had taken, the Moorish men and women
blessing them ; and with the utmost speed they went up the
Henares and across the Alcarias by the caves of Anquita and
the plain of Torancio and Fariza and Cetina. Great was the
spoil my Cid took as he went : little did the Moors know what
daring they had. Next my Cid passed by Alharoa^ down the
valley to Bubierca and Ateca and planted himself over against
Alcocer' upon a round hill, lofty and strong, near to the Salon^ so

' Guadalajara was really taken from the Moors by Alvar Fanez
about this time, and in grateful memory preserves his mounted effigy
on the town-hall, but when he took it he was in the service of Alfonso,
not under ' the Cid. ' Alcala ' is Alcala de Henares, afterwards the
birthplace of Cervantes.

' ^ Alhama, now a popular watering-place, ' the Bath ' or ' Baden '
of Aragon : not to be confounded with the more famous Alhama of the
ballads, near Granada. The Cid's line of march corresponds exactly
with the line of the Madrid and Saragossa railway.

' Generally confounded with the Alcocer south of the Tagus, about

that they could not cut him off from the water, for it was his ,
purpose to take Alcocer. And he levied tribute upon the people
of Alcocer and Ateca and Terrel.' There my Cid abode fifteen
weeks, but when he saw that Alcocer would not surrender he
devised a stratagem. He left one tent pitched, and took the
others and marched his men down the Salon in their armour,
with their swords at their sides. When they of Alcocer
saw it, God ! how they exulted. ' Bread and barley have
failed my Cid, and he retreats like one defeated, leaving
a tent behind him. Let us haste and seize the spoil before
they of Terrel take it.' So they sallied out of Alcocer,
great and small, so eager to seize the prey, that they thought of
nothing else, leaving the gates open and no one to guard them.
"When the good Campeador saw a wide space between them
and thÂ« Castle, he ordered the standard to be turned and gave
his horse the spur, crying, ' Strike home, gentlemen, without falter-
ing : by God's grace, the spoil is ours ! ' and wheeled upon them
in the middle of the plain. God ! how great was the joy of that
morning iV My Cid and Alvar Fanez on their good steeds
ciTarged^fwards, and got between them and the Castle, and my
Cid's vassals fell upon them without mercy, and in a small space
slew three hundred Moors. Those who were in advance made
for the Castle, and sword in hand seixed the gate, and soon the
remainder came up, for the rout was complete ; and in this
manner, look you, my Cid won Alcocer. Pero Bermuez, who
bore the standard, planted it on the highest part ; and said my
Cid : ' Thanks be to the God of Heaven and all his Saints, now
shall we have better lodgings for both man and horse. As for
the Moors, we cannot sell them, and we shall gain nothing JDy
cutting . off their heads. Let us drive them in, for we have the

seventy miles distant. The name, which is simply another form of
Alcazar ' the castle,' has disappeared from the locality here referred
to ; tut there can be no doubt that the Alcocer of the poem was a
Moorish stronghold on the site of the existing Castle of Ateca on the
River Jalon or Salon (the Salo of Martial), about seven miles above
Calatayud.

' Written 'Tfiruel' in the MS., the transcriber having apparently
confounded it vrith Teruel on the Guadalaviar (vj p. 79). The place
meant is now Terrer, a village about three miles from Calatayud.

mastery, and take possession of their houses and make them
serve us.' A heavy blow it was to them of Ateca ; nor did it
please them of Terrel or of Calatayud. They sent word to the ="
king of Valencia, how one whom they call my Cid Ruy Diaz of
Bivar, banished in anger by King Alfonso, had posted himself
over against Alcocer, and taken the Castle. ' Give help,' they said,
' or thou wilt lose Ateca and Terrel and Calatayud, which can-
not escape ; and it will go hard with all the Salon-side, and along
the Siloca too.' Â° And when King Tamin heard it, he despatched â€” -
three thousand Moors, saying, ' Take him alive and bring him
to me, for he must render account for entering my lands.' And
they marched by Segorbe and Celfa, and came to Calatayud,
great numbers joining them as they went, and under the two
kings, named Fariz and Galve, they came and surrounded the
good Cid in Alcocer, and took up positions and pitched tents.
And day and night the Moorish scouts patrolled around, and
mighty was their host. And my Cid's men were cut off from the
water. And they wished to go forth to battle, but he strictly
forbade them ; so for three weeks complete they were besieged,
and at the beginning of the fourth, my Cid turned to take counsel
with his men.

' From water they have cut us oflf, our bread is running low ;
if we would steal away by night, they will not let us go ;
Against us there are fearful odds if we make choice to fight y
What would ye do now, gentlemen, in this our present

plight?'
Minaya was the first to speak : said the stout cavalierj
' Forth- from ,Castile the Gentle thrust, we are but exiles

here ;
Unless we grapple with the Moor bread he will never 5deld ;
A good six hundred men or more we have to take the field ;
In God's name let us falter not, nor countenance delay.
But sally forth and strike a blow upon to-morrow's day.'

Â» Siloca, now the Jilooa, an affluent of the Jalon above Calatayud.



74 THE CID. â–

' Like thee the counsel,' said my Cid ; ' thou speakest to my

mind ;
And ready to support thy word thy hand we ever find.'
Then all the Moors that bide within the walls he bids to go
Forth from the gates, lest they, perchance, his purpose

come to know.
In making their defences good they spend the day and nightj
And at the rising of the sun they arm them for the fight
Then said my Cid : ' Let all go forth, all that are in out'

band ;
Save only two of those on foot, beside the gate to stand.
Here they will bury us if death we meet on yonder plain,
But if we win our battle there, rich booty shall we gain.
And thou Pero Bermuez, this my standard thou shalt hold ;
It is a trust that fits thee well, for thou art stout and bold;
But see that thou advance it not unless I give command.'
Bermuez took the standard and he kissed the Champion's
n ^ hand.
W^^-^ Crhen bursting through the Castle gates upon .the plain they

show ;
Back on their lines in panic fall the watchmen of the foe.
And hurrying to and fro the Moors are arming all around,
While Moorish drums go rolling like to split the very

ground ;
And in hot haste they mass their troops behind their

^ standards twain.
Two mighty bands of men-at-arms â€” to count them it were

vain.
A.nd now their line comes sweeping on, advancing to the

fray,
Sure of my Cid and all his band to make an easy prey.



THE CID. 75

' Now steady, comrades,' said my Cid ; ' our ground we

have to stand ;
Let no man stir beyond the ranks until I give command.'
Bermuez fretted at the word, delay he could not brook;
He spurred his charger to the front, aloft the banner shook :
' loyal Cid Campeador, God give thee aid ! I go
To plant thy ensign in among the thickest of the foe ;
And ye who serve it, be it yours our standard to restore.'
' Not so â€” as thou dost love me, stay ! ' called the Cam-
peador.
Came Pero's answer : 'Their attack I cannot, will not

stay. '
He gave his horse the spur and dashed against the Moors'

array.
To win the standard eager all the Moors await the shock :
Amid a rain of blows he stands unshaken as a rock.
Then cried my Cid â€” ' In charity, on to the rescue â€” ho ! '
With bucklers braced before their breasts, with lances point-
ing low.
With stooping crests and heads bent down above the saddle-
bow.
All firm of hand and high of heart they roll upon the fo^
And. he that in a good hour was born, his clarion voicS

rings out.
And clear above the clang of arms is heard his battle shout,
' Among them, gentlemen ! Strike home, for the love of

charity !
The Champion of Bivar is here â€” Ruy Diaz â€” I am he ! '
Then bearing where Bermuez still maintains unequal fight.
Three hundred lances down they come, their pennons flicker-
ing white ;



76 THE CID.

Down go three hundred Moors to earth, a man to every

blow ;
And when they wheel, three hundred more, as charging

back they go.
It was a sight to see the lances rise and fall that day ;
The shivered shields and riven mail, to see how thick they

lay;
The pennons that went in snow-white come out a gory

red;
The horses running riderless, the riders lying dead ;,
While Moors call on Mohammed, and ' St. James ! ' the
_ Christians cry,

'â–¼And sixty score of Moors and more in narrow compass lie.
Above his gilded saddle-bow there played the Champion's

sword ;
And Minaya Alvar Fanez, Zurita's gallant lord ; '
And Martin Antolinez the worthy Burgalese ;
And Muno Gustioz his squire â€” all to the front were these.
And there was Martin Munoz, he who ruled in Mont

Mayor ;
And there was Alvar Alvarez, and Alvar Salvador ;
And the good Galin Garcia, Stout lance of Aragon ;
And Feliz Munoz, nephew of my Cid the Champion :
Well did they quit themselves that day, all these and many



more.



In rescue of the standard for my Cid Campeador.



' I follow the reading given in Pidal and Janer's edition, 'que
^orita mando.' Sanchez printed 'que corta mando,' which M.
Damas Hinard translates 'donne I'ordre de couper'â€” a rather needless
order at the time. According to Salazar de Mendoza [Dignidades de
Castilla) Alvar Fanez was in fact Lord of Zurita,



THE CID. 77

But Minaya Alvar Fanez â€” the Moors have slain his steed ;
And crowding on the Christians come to aid him in his

need;
His lance lies shivered, sword in hand he showers blows

around,
As, giving back, he, inch by inch, on foot contests the

ground.
He saw it, the Campeador, Ruy Diaz of Castile :
Athwart him on a goodly steed there came an Alguacil ;
With one strong stroke of his right hand he cleft the Moor

- in twain ;
,'And plucked him from the saddle, and flung him on the ^
/ ' plain.

' Now mount, Minaya, mount,' quoth he, ' for thou art my

.right arm ;
I have much need of thee to-day, thou must not come to
/ harm ;
" The Moors maintain a front as yet; unbroken still thfey

stand.'
Mounted again Minaya goes against them sword in hand.
With strength renewed he wields his blade as he his way

doth wend,
Cleaving a path like one who means to make a speedy end.
And he that in a good hour was born at/Fari^ deals three

blows; ^^y^-\

found refuge in Terrel, but Galve fled onward,
anB^e pursuit continued up to Calatayud. Bravely went the
steed of Alvar Fanez : thirty and four Moors he slew, and he
came back wifh his trenchant sword and. his arm from the elbow
downwards dripping blood. ' Now am I content,' said Minayaj .
' for the good tidings will reach Castile that Ruy Diaz has won
a pitched battle.' Back Came my Cid on his good steed, his
â€¢coif twisted, his scarf round his loins, his sword in hand. God !
what a beard he bore ! ' Thanks be to God,' he said, ' for the
great victory we have won.' And in the camp his men took
great spoil of shields and arms and other goods ; and they
found five hundred and ten horses. Great was the joy of the
Christians ; but of their own men fifteen were missing. And my
Cid made' distribution of the money and other treasure 'to his
vassals, and even to the Moors he gave somewhat. To my Cid
in his fifth share there fell a hundred horses. ' Hear me,
Minaya,' said he, ' I would send you to Castile with tidings oÂ£
the battle we have won ; and of this wealth that God has given
us, to offer a gift to King Alfonso of thhty horses saddled and
bridled, with as many swords slung upon the saddle bows : and
here is a wallet full of gold and silver, that in Santa Maria at
Burgos you pay for a thousahd masses. What is left, give to
my wife and daughters, that they may pray for me night and

can say that God gives us aid and we conquer.V On yourreturn,
if y.ou find us not here, follow us. By lance and sword we must
maintain ourselves, else in this narrow land we cannot live.'

So on the morrow Minaya departed. But the land was narrow
and full of evil, and the Moors of the frontier and the; people
beyond kept watch against my Cid and plotted with King
Fariz ; so he bargained with them of Ateca and Terrel and
Calatayud, and sold them Alcocer for three thousand marks.
When my Cid left Alcocer ~tiig Moors, men and women, raised
lamentations. ' Our prayers go before thee,' they said, ' we are
left prosperous by thy means.' And raising his standard the
Campeador passed down the Salon, and on quitting the Salon
he had many good omens. And he pushed forward and planted
himself on a hill which is above Mont'real.' Marvellous and
high was the hill, and safe from attack on every side ; and thence
he laid under tribute Daroca, which is behind, and Molina, which
is on the other side, and Teruel, which is farther on, and in his
hand he held Celfa de Canal.' Alvar Fanez went to Cas tile
and presented the thirty horses to the king. Said the king,'-!
' It is too soon at the end of three weeks to take into favour a I
man who has earned the wrath of his lord,, but since it cJSmes 1
from the Moors I accept this gift, and I am even glad my Cid i
has won such spoil. For you, Minaya, I release your lands i
and honours, and give you my pardon ; but as to my Cid, I say /
nothing save this, that throughout my kingdom any stout and (
valiant men who may wish to join my Cid, I leave free both as}
to their persons and estates.' ^

Meanwhile he who was born and girt on the sword in a good
hour took up his abode on this hill, and, whether the people be
Moorish or Christian, it will be called ' The hill of my Cid ' in all
writings. There he remained fifteen full weeks, levying tribute
over a wide country. But when he saw that Minaya delayed,
he made a night march, and passing by Teruel, he fixed himself
in the pineÂ»wood of Tebar, and all the lands that side he laid
under tribute, up to Saragossa. Thence he moved to the pass

' Mont'real. â€” See Introduction p. 43 (note). Celfa de Canal is
apparently Alcala de la Selva, to the east of Teruel.

utlaw of Castile was doing much harm.

The Count of Barcelona,Â® when the tidings met his ear
How that my Cid Ruy Diaz made forays far and near,
And laid the country waste, with wrath his inmost soul was

stirred,
And in his anger hastily he spake a braggart word â€”
' He Cometh to insult me, doth my Cid, he of Bivar.
Up to my very court, methinks, he means to carry war.
My nephew he hath wronged ; the wrong remaineth unre-
paired :
And now the lands that I protect to harry hath he dared.
No challenge have I sent to him, nor sought him for my

foe ;
But now I call him to account, since he will have it so.'
Great mustering there is of Moors and Christians through

the land,
A mighty host of men-at-arms he hath at his command
Two days, three nights, they march to seek the Good One
of Bivar,

' The Puerto de Alucant M. Damas Hinard supposes to have been
in the mountains between Navarre and Aragon ; but the context shows
that it must have been on the south side of the Ebro. The present
Alacon on the Rio Martin is most likely the place meant.

5 The poet is in error when he calls this Count of Barcelona
' Raymond Berenger. ' There were two Counts of Barcelona, brothers,
Raymond Berenger and Berenger Raymond. The former, who was
probably the (l\S% antagonist at Almenara, was assassinated in
December 1082, leaving an infant son, the nephew referred to lower
down. It was the other, Berenger Raymond, who attacked the Cid
on this occasion. The nephew was the Count Raymond Berenger III. ,
who afterwards married the Cid's daughter Maria, and by his second
marriage with Countess Dulce became Count of Provence.

- Tebar;Â«
And such the speed of their advance, that, cumbered with

his spoils,
And unaware, my Cid well nigh was taken in the toils.
The tidings reached my Cid as down the sierra side he went,
Then straightway to Count Raymond he a friendly message

sent :
' Say to the Count that he, meseems, to me no grudge doth

owe :
Of him I take no spoil, with him in peace I fain would go. '
' Nay,' said the Count, * for all his deeds he hath to make

amends :
This outlaw must be made to know whose honour he

offends,'

â€¢ The exact position of the Pine-wood of Tebar (or Iber, as it is
called in the Gesta) can no more be identified than that of the adjacent
Ibera where the. Scipios defeated Hasdrubal. Clearly, however, it was
in the intricate mountain region to the N.E. of Teruel, between the
basins of the Ebro and Guadalaviar. According to the poem, it was
in the neighbourhood of Montalvan and the valley of the Rio Martin,
and according to the Gesta it lay between Morella and Calamocha.
Combining these indications, we may conjecture that it was somewhefe
near Segura (where there are still remains of an extensive pine forest),
and that the head of the Martin valley may have been that compara-
tively level ground, ' qui planior in cunctis terris istis videtur esse,' on
which, according to the Gesta, the Cid challenged Berenger to attack
him ; while the long ridge of the Sierras of Cucalon and San Just might
well be the 'immensum Hab'ntiarum montem,' from the summit of
which Berenger's scouts, sent out from Calamocha, discovered the Cid's
camp, and from behind which the Count himself made the sudden
descent described in both the Poem and the Gesta. It is worth notice
that the Pena del Cid, mistaken by Huber and Damas Hinard for the
Poyo (v. Int, p. 43), is within a few irules of Segur^ on the road to
Montalvan.



82 THE CID.

With utmost speed the messenger Count Raymond's answer

brought ;
Then of a surety knew my Cid a battle must be fought.
' Now, cavaliers,' quoth he, ' make safe the booty we have

won.
Look to your weapons, gentlemen ; with speed your armour

don.
On battle bent Count Raymond comes ; a mi^ty host hath

he
Of Moors and Christians ; fight we must if hence we would

go free.
Here let us fight the battle out, since fight we must perforce.
On with your harness, cavaliers, quick ! saddle, and to

horse !
Yonder they come, the linen breeks,' all down the mountain

side,
For saddles they have Moorish pads, with slackened girths

they ride :
Our saddles are G^ician make, our leggings tough and

stout :
A hundred of us gentlemen should scatter such a rout!
Before they gain the level plain, home with the lance charge

we.
And then, for every blow we strike, we empty saddles three,
"ount Raymond Berenger shall know with whom he has

to do ;

And dearly in Tebar to-day his raid on me shall rue.'
In serried squadron while he speaks they form around my

Cid.

' ' Calfas : ' probably short and loose linen drawers, like those worn
by the Valencian peasantry at the present day.

Each grasps his lance, and firm and square eadi sits upon
his steed.

Over against them down the hill they watch the Franks ' ^_
descend,

On to the level ground below, where plain and mountain
blend.

Then gives my Cid the word to charge â€” ^with a good will
they go :

Fast ply the lances ; some they pierce, and some they over-
throw.

And he that in a good hour w-as born soon hath he won the
field ;

And the Count Raymond Berenger he hatli compelled to^'"^
yield ;

And reaping honour for his beard a noble prize hath
made ;

A thousand marks of silver worth, the great Colada blade.*
Unto his quarters under guard the captive Count he sent,

While his men haste to gather in their spoils in high con-
tent

Then for my Cid Don Roderick a banquet they prepare ;

But little doth Count Raymond now for feast or banquet
care.

They bring him meat and drink, but he repels them with
disdain.

'No morsel will I touch,' said he, 'for all the wealth of
Spain.

' One of the treasures of the splendid Armeria at Madrid is a sword
which tradition asserts to be the identical Colada of the Cid. The
blade, which is of moderate length, and broad, straight, and double-
edged, may well be of the eleventh century, but the hilt is probably of
the fifteenth or sixteenth.

Let soul and body perish now ; life why should I prolong,
Conquered^ and captive at the hands of such an ill-breeched

throng ? '
' Nay,' said my Cid ; ' take bread and wine ; eat, and thou

goest free ;
If not, thy realms in Christendom thou never more shalt

see.'
' Go thou, Don Roderick,' said the Count, ' eat if thou wilt,

but I
Have no more lust for meat or drink : I only crave to die."
Three days, while they the booty share, for all that they

entreat,
The Count his purpose holds unchanged, refusing still to

eat.
Then said my Cid, ' I pray thee. Count, take food and trust

to me;
Thyself and two knights of thy train I promise to set free.'
Glad was Count Raymond in his heart when he the promise

heard â€”
' A marvel that will be, my Cid, if thou dost keep thy word.'
' Then, Count, take food, and when I see thy hunger satisfied,
My word is pledged to let thee go, thyself and two beside.
But understand, one farthing's worth I render not again
Of what has been in battle lost and won on yonder plain.
I give not back the lawful spoils I fairly win in fight ;
But for mine own and vassals' wants I hold them as my

right.
My followers are needy men ; I cannot if I would ;
For spoil from thee and others won is all our livelihood.
And such, while God's good will it is, must be*our daily life,
As outcasts forced to wander, with an angry king at strife.'



THE CID. 8s

With lighter heart Count Raymond called for water for his

hands,
And then with his two gentlemen, sent by the Cid's com-
mands,
He blithely sat him down to meat ; God ! with what gust

ate he ! '
And glad was the Campeador such heartiness to see.
Quoth he, ' Until thou eat thy fill we part not, Count, to-day.'
' Nor loth am I,' Count Raymond said, ' such bidding to obey.'
So he and his two cavaliers a hearty meal they made :
It pleased my Cid to watch his hands, how lustily they

played.
'Now, if thou wilt,' Count Raymond said, 'that we are

satisfied.
Bid them to lead the horses forth, that we may mount and

ride.
Never since I have been a Count have I yet broken fast
With such a relish ; long shall I remember this repast.'
Three palfreys with caparisons of costly sort they bring.
And on the saddles robes of fur and mantles rich they fling.
Thus, with a knight on either hand, away Count Raymond

rides ;
While to the outposts of the camp his guests the Champion

guides,
' Now speed thee, Count ; ride on,' quoth he, ' a free Frank

as thou art. 9
For the brave spoil thou leavest me I thank thee from my

heart ;

' ' Aguisa de muy franco : ' there seems to be something in the
nature of a pun here on the double meaning of the word 'franco,'â€”
'free,' and 'Frank;* in which latter sense it is already applied to
Berenger's Catalan troopers.

And if to win it back again perchance thou hast a mind,
Come thou and seek me when thou wilt ; I am not far to

find.
But if it be not to thy taste to try another day,
Still, somewhat, be it mine or thine, thou earnest away.'
â€” ' Nay ! go in peace for me, my Cid : no more I seek of

thee ;
And thou, I think, for one year's space hast won enough

of me.'
He spurred his steed, but, as he rode, a backward glance

he bent,
Still fearing to the last my Cid his promise would repent :
A thing, the world itself to win, my Cid would not have

done :
"^"--.iJo perfidy was ever found in him, the Perfect One.

y/ When the Count had departed, he of Bivar turned to his
men and set them to collect together the spoils they had won.
Here beginneth the achievement of my Cid of Bivar ; ^ leaving

' ' Aquis conpie9a la gesta de Myo Cid el de Biuar.' These words
have been generally held to indicate the commencement of one of the
' cantatas ' or lays out of which the poem was composed. I think,
however, it is far more likely that the word ' gesta,' on which the
assumption rests, is here used merely in its strict and original sense of
'achievement;' as it is, for instance, in the poem of the 'Libro de
Alexandre ' â€” ' Que ouo de su gesta dictador tan onrrado ; ' and the con-
text bears out the supposition. For it is, in fact, at this point that begins
what was in strictest truth the achievement of the Cid's life, his conquest
of Valencia. 'By the defeat of Berenger he had secured the sinews of
war for a campaign, and disposed of the only enemy who could interfere
with his advance, and so, quitting the scenes of his former forays, he
began a new enterprise, â€” 'began,' as the poet adds, 'to make war
towards the salt sea ' (' confers de guerrear '). The other interpretation
involves the necessity of treating ' gesta ' as the equivalent of ' chanson
de geste,' for which it would be difficult- to show any authority.

Saragossa and the lands on that side, and Huesca,' and the lands
of Montalvan, he began to make war towards the salt sea. The
sun rises in the east, and he turned in that direction, and took
Xerica and Onda and Almenar, and conquered all the lands of
Burriana, and moreover Murviedro.' Then did my Cid see that
God was aiding him. Within Valencia there was no little fear,
and they of Valencia took counsel together, and marching by
night, they came and encamped against Murviedro. When my
Cid saw them he said, ' We are in their lands and we do them
much evil : we drink their wine and eat their bread : if they
come to besiege us, they have a right to do it. Let a summons
be sent to Xerica and Alucant and Onda and Almenar and
Burriana, to all who are bound to aid us.' And on the third day
all were brought together, and said my Cid, ' To-morrow will we
go forth to meet this host, like exiles from a far country : then it
will be seen who deserves his pay.' With the dawn my Cid>
attacked them, in the name of God, and of the Apostle
Santiago, crying, ' Strike home, gentlemen, with heart and
good will ! I am Ruy Diaz, my Cid, he of Bivar ! ' And
then you might see tent-ropes broken, and poles plucked up
and tents overturned. On the other side, Alvar Fanez fell upon
them, and despite of themselves they had to give back and flee.
Two Moorish kings were slain in the pursuit and it continued -
up to Valencia. Great were the spoils which my Cid made, and
he took Cebolla* and all that lies beyond ; and my Cid and all
his company were glad, and his horsemen began to make forays
by night, reaching to CuUera and Xativa,' and even as far as

2 Most likely Huesa, near Seguta, on the south side of the Ebro,
not Huesca, to the north of Saragossa. It should be noted that the
poet ignores, as foreign to his purpose, the Cid's relations with the King
of Saragossa and his battles beyond the Ebro.

he took away their bread from thenii Bitter were the lamenta-
tions in Valencia, for they knew not what to do, nor was there
any side from which food might come to them ; nor could
father help son nor son father, nor friend give comfort to friend.
When the bread runs low, to see the women and children die of
hunger,^sirs, it is a piteous tale. Those outside saw their misery,
but could not help them. They sent word to the King of
Morocco, for they were in great friendship with him of the
Bright Mountains,' but he gave them no help nor came to aid
them, and my Cid knew it and was glad of heart. ''And he
caused it to be proclaimed through Navarre and Aragon and
Castile : ' WhoSo would rid himself of care and be rich, let him
come to my Cid, who purposes to beleaguer Valencia, to give it
to the Christians.' Great numbers flocked to him out of fair
Christendom, and when my Cid saw them collected he marched
against Valencia and beleaguered it closely, suffering none to
go in or out : but he-granted a day of grace in case any should
come to relieve it. [Nine months complete he sat before it, and

a passage in the poem of Fernan Gonzalez (c. 37), and another in
that of Alfonso XI. (c. 2437) ; and, besides, we know from Ibn Bassam

Count it ? All were rich, as many as were there. Thirty-
thousand marks in money fell to my Cid in his fifth part, and
the other wealth, who could count it ? And joyful was my Cid
and all his men when his standard rested on the summit of the
Alcazar. Word was brought to the king of Seville how
Valencia was taken, and he came with thirty thousand men-at-
arms, and gave battle on the Huerta, and Jie of the long beard
routed them. Up to Xativa the rout continued, and you might
have seen a struggle at the passage of the Jucar,' and the Moors
drinking their fill of water in spite of themselves. Rich was the
spoil when they took Valencia, but much more gainful, look
you, was' this victory : even to the least of them, there fell a
hundred marks of silver. Now was the beard of my Cid
growing great and increasing in length, and said he, ' For the
love of King Alfonso who hath banished me neither shall
scissors come near it, nor a hair of it be plucked, and it shall
be famous among Moors and Christians.' And to Minaya he
said : ' I desire to send you to Castile, to King Alfonso, my
natural lord, with a hundred horses of this spoil, that you kiss
his hand for me and pray that of his grace he allow me to brmg
my wife and daughters to this distant land that we have won.'
Meanwhile there had come from the east a holy man, the
Bishop Don Jerome by name,' one of learning and repute, and
valiant both on foot and on horseback, who came to my Cid's
gates in the hope of seeing Moors in the field and having his fill
of fighting. My Cid was pleased, and he said to Alvar FaneTK
' Since God is willing to aid us, we should show our gratitude. 1
In these lands of Valencia will I make a bishopric and give it I
to this good Christian : it will be good news to bring when^U '
go to Castile.' Minaya departed for Castile : I will not enu-

evacuation of Valencia in 1 102, he was translated to Zamora, with which

his hand, and showed how my Cid was prospering in a far
country, and had won Xerica and Murviedro and Castellon, and
the strong fortress Pena Cadiella, and withal was Lord of
Valencia, 'and had made a bishop with his hands, and fought
and won five pitched battles, and gained much booty, in token
whereof he sent these hundred horses to the king. And the
king was pleased, but Count Garcfa Ordonez ' was vexed.
'Methinks,' he said, 'there cannot be a man in the land of the
loors, for my Cid does as he pleases.' But the king said, ' Be
f silent ; for in every way he serves me better than you.' And he
(gave leave for Dona Ximena and her daughters to depart from
jthe monastery, and ordered an escort to attend them while they
[ shou ld be in his dominions. At this the Infantes of Carrion
sS3 between themselves : ' My Cid is growing in importance. _ It
would be well for us to marry his daughters, but we dare not
think of it, for he is of Bivar and we are Counts of Carrion.'
They said nothing of this to any one, but they bade Minaya to
give their salutations to my Cid of Bivar. And Rachel and
Vidas came to Minaya and fell at his feet saying, ' The Cid has
undone us, look you, if he does not help us.' ' I will see to it^
with my Cid,' said Minaya : ' what you have done he will take
into consideration.' "" God grant it,' said Rachel and Vidas : ' if
not, we shall leave Burgos and go to seek him.' And Minaya
and the ladies departed, and passed by Medina and came to
Molina,* where the Moor Abengalvon ruled, and well did he
serve them ; they had no lack of anything they desired. And
when they were within three leagues of Valencia, the news was
brought to my Cid, and he was joyful more than ever he had
been, having tidings of what he loved best. And they led forth'
Babieca, then lately won, and as yet my Cid knew not whether
he was swift or well managed. And he leaped upon him and
ran a course so marvellous that all wondered, and from that day
Babieca was held to be worth all Spain.* Then he dismounted

and went to meet his wife and daughters, and' fondly embraced
them, while their eyes were filled with tears through the joy they
felt. Then said he who was born in a good hour, ' My heart
and soul come with me jnto Valencia, this heritage I have won
for you.' And my Cid went with them to the Alcazar, and led
them up to thte highest part, and with their bright eyes they
looked around. They beheld Valencia, how the city lay, and
on the other side the sea, and the great broad Huerta ; and they
lifted up their hands, thanking God for a prize so fair. ^^

Now winter was past and March was coming in, and King)
Yucef of Morocco, being wroth with my Cid Don Roderick^
CoHected his forces, and with fifty thousand m,en-at-arms put to
sea and came to Valencia and pitched his tents. Said my Cid :
' I thank God and the blessed' Mary mother, that I have my
wife and daughters here : they shall see me fight, and how we
sojourn and win our bread in the land of the stranger.' And
he took them up to the Alcazar, and when they saw the pitched
tents, they said, * Cid, God be with you, what is this ? ' ' Fear
not, honoured wife, ' he said : ' it is marvellous great wealth that
comes to us. Scarcely have you arrived but they bring a gift to
you â€” a dowry against the marriage of your daughters. Fear not
to see me fight ; my heart swells within me, because ye are by,
and with God's help I shall win this battle.' And my Cid
sprang upon Babieca, and taking the standard, they sallied forU*>
from Valencia. Four thousand less thirty followed my Cid, andj"
they went forth joyfully to attack fifty thousand. My Cid p'liea
his. lance and sword ; and, from the elbow downwards dripping
blood, he slew so many Moors they could not be counted, and he!
dealt three blows at King Yucef, who escaped by the speed of'
his horse and took refuge in CuUera. All the spoil remained^n ,
his hands ; the fifty thousand were reckoned by counting, "and^
not more than a hundred and four had escaped. Between gold
and silver, they found three thousand marks, and of other spoils
there was no count. Back upon Babieca came my Cid, sword
in hand, and before the ladies, who were waiting for him, he
drew rein. 'My homage to you, ladies,' he said; 'great

mencement of his career and surviving him ; in which case the steed
would have attained, according to their chronology, the partriarchal
age of over sixty years.

booty have I won for you. While ye held Valencia, I have won
on the plain. It was the will of God and all his Saints ; since at
your coming they have granted us such spoil. Behold my
gory sword and sweating steed ; thus are Moors vanquished on
the field.' He gave orders to preserve the tent of the king of
Morocco : ' this,' said he, ' will I send to Alfonso of Castikj
fthat he may believe the tales of my Cid's booty.' And he said
Tto Minaya : ' To-morrow shall you go with these two hundred

â– ^ / horses of my fifth share as a present, that King Alfonso may
[ not speak ill of the ruler of Valencia.' He bade Pero Bermuez
toa'ccompany him, and travelling day and night across sierras
arid forests and rivers, they came to Valladolid, where the
king was. And the king was pleased. ' Willingly,' said he,
' I receive the gift my Cid has sent nie, and may the day
rco me when he shall be reconciled with me.' But the Count Don

^/ Garcia was wroth, and withdrawing apart, with ten of his kins-
Ljnen,hesaid : 'It is a marvel, how the honour.of the Cid increases :
by it are we humiliated â€” by this insolent conquering of kings in
battle, and sending horses as if he had found them dead.' But
said the Infantes of Carrion, taking counsel together privily,
' The fame of my Cid is growing great : let us ask his daughters
in marriage ; so shall we increase in honour and advance
ourselves.' So they came to King Alfonso with this design,
saying, ' We seek a favour of you as our king and natural lord,
that you demand for us the Campeador's daughters, that we
marry them, to their honour and to our advantage.' For a good
hour the king thought and considered. ' I have banished the
good Campeador, and while I have done him evil, he has
rendered me good service. I know not whether this marriage
will be to his taste ; but since ye desire it, let us enter into nego-
tiation.' And he sent for Minaya Alvar Fanez and Pero
Bermuez, and took them aside into a chamber. ' My Cid the
.Campeador,' said he, 'serves me, and he shall have pardon of
me. Diego and Ferrando the Infantes of Carrion have a mind
to wed with his two daughters. Be true messengers I bid ye, and
tell the good Campeador that he will grow in honour by an
intermarriage with the Infantes of Carrion.' And Minaya and
Pero said : ' We will make the demand as you bid us ; let the Cid
do as pleases him.' So they took leave of the king, and departed



THE CID.

for Valencia with their company. And the good Campeador
went forth to meet them, and he embraced them, saying,
' Welcome, Minaya, and thou, Pero Bermuez. In few lands are
there two such barons.* How is the health of my Lord Alfonso .'
is he content, and doth hereceive my gift ?' Said Minaya, ' Heart
and soul he is content, and he gives you his love.' < ThanlfVlSel
to God,' said my Cid ; and with that they opened the proposal/
of Alfonso of Leon, that he should give his daughters to the]
Infantes of Carrion. When my Cid heard it, he thoughfaSd
considered a good hour. ' For this,' said he, ' I give thanks to
Christ my Lord ; I was banished and stripped of honour, and
with great toil have I won what I possess. Thanks be to God for
the king's grace, and that he asks my daughters for the Infantes
of Carrion. They are haughty, and have a faction in the Court.
I would have no taste for the match, but since he, who is
mightier than we, advises, let us consent and be silent ; and mjiy
God in Heaven direct us for the best.' Then they wrote a\
letter to the king, that what he desired, that would the Campea dor \
do. And the king was glad, and said : ' Let the meeting be three
weeks hence. If I am alive, I will go without fail.' And my Cid
made preparation for the meeting, and they set forth from
Valencia. And when King Alfonso knew the good Campeador
was coming, he went forth to receive him with honour. And
when he who was born in a good hour beheld him, he ordered
all his men to halt, and placed himself hands and knees upon

. the earth, and took the grass of the field in his teeth, shedding
tears from his eyes, so great was the joy he felt, and thus did he

. do homage to Alfonso his lord. But it grieved the king. ' ' Rise,'
he said, ' Cid Campeador, kiss my hands, not my feet. If you do
so, you shall not have my love.' Still on his bended knees, said
the Campeador, ' I ask grace of you, my natural lord, that you
will here grant me your love, so that all present may hear it.
Said the king : ' That will I with heart and soul. Here do I
pardon you, and grant you my love throughout my kingdojn
from this day forth.' Said my Cid : ' I thank God of Heaven,
and next to him, you, Alfonso, my lord, and this present com-
pany.' And on bended knees he kissed his hand, and rising to

t ' Tales dos varones.'

his feet saluted him on the mouth. That day my Cid Ruy
Diaz was the guest of the king, who could not satisfy himself in
showing him affection, ever gazing on his beard, which had
grown so mighty ; and all that were there marvelled at my Cid.
And the next day my Cid ordered his men to prepare a banquet
for as many as were present, and in such fashion did he entertain
them, that all agreed they had not feasted better for three years
back, Onthe morrow, when they came forth from mass, the
king opened the negotiation. ' Give ear, all ye in attendance,
counts and gentlemen. I make a request of my Cid the
Campeador. Christ grant that it be for his advantage. I ask
your daughters Dona Â£lvira and Dona Sol for wives for the
Infantes of Carrion â€” an honourable and fitting marriage, as it
seems to me.' . Said the Campeador in answer : ' I have no
marriageable daughters, for they are of tender age ; but I and
they are in your hands. Give them as it pleases you ; I
am content.' Then the Infantes of Carrion rose atnd kissed his
hand, and said the king : ' I thank you, Cid, that you give me
your daughters for the Infantes of Carrion.' But said my Cid :
' It is you who give my daughters in marriage, not I. I will not
give them from my hand, nor shall they vaunt themselves of it.'
The king made answer : ' Here is Alvar Fanez ; let him take
them from your hands and give them to the Infantes.' With
that my Cid took his leave of King Alfonso, and set forth for
Valencia, giving the Infantes in charge to Don Pero and Muno
Giistioz. Dona Ximena and his daughters met him, and he
said : ' By this marriage of yours we shall increase in honour.;
BiifrTcjok you, it was not I that brought it about. My lord
Alfonso demanded you so earnestly, that I knew not how to say,
no, and in his hands have I placed you, my daughters. Believe
niePit is he who bestows you in marriage, not I.' Then they set
aboiit preparing the palace. From top to bottom it was adorned
with hangings of^urple and samite and choice doth. You
w^ldhave relished living "and eating in that palace. Then
th^y sent for the Infantes, who rode forth to the palace arrayed
in rich raiment. God ! how meekly they entered. My Cid and
his vassals received them, and they did homage to him and to his
wife, and seated themselves upon ac^tljLifiuch^ Then said the
Campeador, rising to his feetr^ASwehave somewhat to do, why

dowedelay? Comehither,AlvarFanez, whom I love and esteem :
here are my two daughters, I place them in your hands. You
know what the king hath commanded. I would not fail in
aught that has been agreed. Give them to the Infantes of
Carrion, with your blessing, and let us proceed.' Then said
Minayato the Infantes : ' By the hand of King Alfonso, who hag
laid the charge upon me, I give you these ladies of high de^ee,
that ye take them for wives in honour and respect.' This done,
they went forth from the palace to Santa Maria, and the bishop,
Don Jerome, received them at the door of the church and
gave them his benediction and chanted the mass. And from
the church they rode out to the Glera of Valencia. God ! how
gallantly my Cid and his vassals bore their arms. He that was
bom in a good hour changed three horses, and with what he saw
he was well content, for the Infantes of Carrion rode well ; and
the next day my Cid set up seven shields, and before they
returned to dine, they broke them all. Rich was the wedding
festival in the honoured Alcazar, and it lasted for fifteen days.
And then those who had arrived for the marriage returned to
Castile, taking their leave of Ruy Diaz and the ladies and gentle-
men. And my Cid and his sons-in-law remained in Valencia^
and there the Infantes abode well nigh two years. Great was\
the affection shown to them, and the Cid was glad, and all his \
vassals. The blessed Mary and our Father grant that my Cid
may have joy of this marriage.

Here end the verses of this lay. The Creator and all his
Saints be with you.



My Cid was in Valencia, with his vassals and his sons-in-law
the Infantes of Carrion. Stretched upon a couch, the Campeador
was sleeping, when, wot ye, a mishap befel them. The lion
broke loose and escaped from the cage, and in sore fear were
they in the midst of the court. They of the Campeador
wrapped their mantles upon their arms, and gathered round the
couch, and stood over their lord. But Ferran Gonzalez seeing
no place of safety, neither open chamber nor tower, crept be-
neath 'the couch, so great was his fear, and Diego Gonzalez fled
through the door, crying : ' I shall neyer see Carrion more,' and

Toui

in his terror threw himself across a wine-press beam, with his
mantle and robe all besmeared. Thereupon he who was born
in a good hour awoke, and seeing the couch surrounded by his
good barons, he said : ' What means this, comrades ? what would
ye?' 'Honoured lord,' said they, 'it is the lion gives us
dread.' Then my Cid rose to his feet, and drew his mantle on
his neck, and advanced on the lion. And the lion, when he saw
him, was abashed and bent his head before my Cid, and Don
Roderick grasped him by the mane, and dragging him put him
in the cage : a marvel to all that were by. And returning to
tEeTJalace through the court, he asked for his sons-in-law, but
55und them not. Despite of calling, there came no answer.
And when they were found, they came back so pale, that
laughter, â€” you never saw the like â€” ran round the court. My
Cid the Campeador bade it cease, but the Infantes of Carrion
held themselves grievously insulted.
" WEile^ matters stood so, a thing befel, which gave them sore
trouble. The army of Morocco, and King Bucar,' if you have
^heard tell of him, came and beleaguered Valencia with fifty
thousand pitched tents. My Cid and all his barons were glad.
jThanks to God, it was more spoil for them. But, look you, the
1 Infantes of Carrion were troubled at heart to see so many tents
( of the Moors, for which they had no relish. ' We look for booty,'
said they, ' and not loss. ' Now we shall have to go forth to battle,--
and it is certain we shall never see Carrion again, and the
Campeador's daughters will be left widows.' Muiio Gustioz '
heard their discourse, and carried the news to my Cid. ' See
how your sons-in-law are afeared ; how courageous they are :
at the prospect of battle they are longing for Carrion. Go give
them heart, and God speed you.' And my Cid Don Roderick
went out smiling. ' God be with you, sons-in-law,' said he.
' Battle is my desire. Carrion is yours. In your arms ye have
my daughters, bright as the sun. Rest in Valencia at your wilL
I know how to deal with the Moors, and with God's grace I will
endeavour to overthrow them.'

' King Bucar.â€” The person here meant is the' Almoravide general,
Abu Bekr, the lieutenant of Yusof ; but it is very doubtfiil whether
he commanded in this battle. See Introduction, p. 42.

[The break, owing to the abstraction of a leaf from the Bivar Codex,
occurs at this point. The defect in the narrative is partially supplied
farther on by the speech of Pero Bermuez at the Cortes of Toledo. We
may assume that the brothers, or at least Ferrando, stung by the im-
putation of cowardice, make some demonstration of zeal, which leads
to the encounter described by Pero.],

' May the time come when I may deserve as much of both of
you.' ^ They went back together, and as Don Pero agreed, the
honour was bestowed upon Ferrandq. My Cid and his vassals
rejoiced. ' Please God,' said he, ' both my sons-in-law will yet
bear themselves stoutly in battle,' and so say his followers all.

Loud from among the Moorish tents the call to battle

comes,
And some there are, unused to war, awed by the rollihd

drums.
Ferrando and Diego most : of troubled mind are they ;
Not of their will they find themselves before the "Moors

â€¢ that day.
' Pero Bermuez,' said the Cid, ' my , nephew- stanch and

true,
Ferrando and Diego do I give in charge to you ;

' These are the last words of Pero's reply to Ferran Gonzalezj who
had probably expressed his gratitude. There is, perhaps, a touch of
dry contemptuous sarcasm in the answer, which would be very charac-
teristic of Pero and his estimate of the Infantes. The line has an
interest for English readers, for by means of a conjectural emendation
of it, known only to hiinself and the Marquis de la Romana, Frere was
able to accredit a. confidential messenger to the latter when in the
French service in Denmark. He proposed to read ' que vos meres-
cades ' in place of 'que vos meresca dos.' Frere's emendation is
ingenious. It is a decided improvement in construction, an4 perhaps
in sense also, if we take it to mean ' when you may deserve the like
thanks of me.'

Be yours the task in this day's fight my sons-in-law to shield,
For, by God's grace, to-day we sweep the Moors from off

the field.'
' Nay,' said Bermuez, ' Cid, for all the love I bear to thee.
The safety of thy sons-in-law no charge of mine shall be.
Let him who will the office fill ; my place is at the front,
Among the comrades of my choice to, bear the battle's

brunt ;
As it is thine upon the rear, against surprise to guard,
And ready stand to give support where'er the fight goes

hard.'
Came Alvar Fanez : ' Loyal Cid Campeador,' he cried,
' This battle surely God ordains â€” He will be on our side ;
Now give the order of attack as seems to thee the best,

fray;
To strike a blow against the Moor in battle if I may,
And in the field win honour for my order and my hand.
It is for this that I am here, far from my native land.
Unto Valencia did I come to cast my lot with you,
All for the longing that I had to slay a IVEoor or two.
And so, in warlike guise I come, with blazoned shield, and

lance.
That I may flesh my blade to-day, if God but give the

chance.
Then send me to the front to do the bidding of my heart :

' Good ! ' said my Cid. ' Go, flesh thy blade; there stand

thy Moorish foes.
Now shall we see how gallantly our fighting Abbot goes.'
He said ; and straight the Bishop's spurs are in his charger's

flanks,
And with a will he flings himself against the Moorish

ranks.
By his good fortune, and the aid of God, that loved him

well.
Two of the foe before his point at the first onset fell.
His lance he broke, he drew his sword â€” God ! how the

good steel played !
Two with the lance he slew, now five go down beneath his

blade.
But many are the Moors, and round about him fast they

close,
And on his hauberk, and his shield, they rain a shower of

blows.
He in the good hour bom beheld Don Jerome sorely

pressed ;
He braced his buckler on his arm, he laid his lance in rest.
And aiming where besetl5y^M6brs "Ihe Bishop stood at

bay,.
Touched Babieca with the spur and plunged into the firay ,;
And flung to earth unhorsed were seven, and lying dead

Where breaking through the Moorish ranks came the

Campeador.
God, it so pleased, that this should be the finish of the

fight ;
Before the lances of my Cid the fray became a flight ;

And then to see the tent-ropes burst, the tent-poles pros-
trate flung !

As the Cid's horsemen crashing came the Moorish tents
among.

Forth from the camp King Bucar's Moors they drove upon
the plain,

And charging on the rout, they rode and cut them down
amain ;

Here severed fell the mail-clad arm, there lay the steel-
capped head,

And here the charger, riderless, ran trampling on the dead.

Behind King Bucar, as he fled, my Cid came spurring on ;

' Now, turn the4 Bucar, turn ! ' he cried ; ' here is the
Bearded One ;

Here is that Cid you came to seek, King from beyond the
main,

Let there be peace and amity to-day between us twain.'

Said Bucar, ' Nay ; thy naked sword, thy rushing steed, I
see ;

If these mean amity, then God confound such amity.^

Thy hand and mine shall never join unless in yonder
deep.

If the good steed that I bestride his footing can but keep.'

Swift was the steed, but swifter borne on Babieca's stride,

Three fathoms from the sea my Cid rode at King Bucar's
side ;

Aloft his blade a moment played, then on the helmet's
crown,

Shearing the steel-cap dight with gems, Colada he brought
down.

Down to the belt, through helm and mail, he deft the

Moor in twain.
And so he slew King Bucar, who came from beyond the

main. â€” ^



This was the battle, this the day, when he the great swori I

won.
Worth a full thousand marks of gold â€” the famous Bran

Tizon.*

And as my Cid came back from the slaughter, he lifted up
his eyes and saw Diego and Ferrando coming, and he rejoiced,
smiling brightly.' ' Welcome, sons-in-law,' said he : ' my sons are
ye both. I know now that ye delight in battle. Good news of you
will go to Carrion, how we have ' vanquished King Bucar.'
Then came Minaya Alvar Fanez, from the elbow down dripping
- ^ith b lood, for twenty Moors and more had he slain ; his
shield upon Tiis neck all dinted ; little recked he of the lance-
thrusts ; those who had given them had not profited by them.

fjSage. Let us remove them from Valencia and from the power
\ of the Campeador, and afterwards on the road we will do our
1 will, so that they reproach us no more with the affair of the lion.
We will flout the daughters of the Campeador. With this
wealth we shall he rich for ever ; we shall be able to wed the
daughters of kings or emperors, for by birth we are Counts of
Carrion.' With this design they returned, and said Ferran
Gonzalez : ' God be with you, Cid Campeador. May it please
Dona Ximena, and you, and Minaya Alvar Fanez, and all
present : give us our wives, that we take them to our lands of
Carrion and establish them in the towns we give them for
portions and honours, so that your daughters may see what we
possess and what will be the possessions of the sons we beget.'
Said the Campeador, ' I will give you my daughters and some-
what of my wealth ; ' for the Cid cared not to be thus slighted.
''Ye give them towns and lands for portions in the lands of
Carrion, and I as a marriage portion give them three thousand
marks of silver, and to you I give mules and palfreys and horses
strong andâ€”swifi^aQdraiment of cloth and robes, and two
swords, [Golada and Tizoij : well you know I won them in
knightly fashion." My sons are ye, since I give you my daughters,
andTn them ye take from me the core of my heart.' Let them
of Galicia, and Castile, and Leon know how I have sent my
sons-in-law home with wealth.' Thus did they go forth from
Valencia the Bright, and held their way across the Huerta. ,
Cheerful went my Cid and all his company ; but he who girt â–
/the sword in a good hour saw in the omens that these
( marriages would not be without some mishap, but it was vain
to repent of having made them. And he said : 'Feliz Muiioz,
\thou art my nephew and the cousin of my daughters. I charge
thee go with them even unto Carrion, and see the heritage given
fco them, and return with the tidings. Take ye your way by
J^olina, and salute my friend Abengalvon the Moor, that he
receive my sons-in-law with honour, and for love of me escort
them as far as Medina.' The parting was as that of the nail
from the flesh, and then he of the good hour returned to Valencia.
And the Infantes of Carrion took their way by Santa Maria de

' Literally, ' the web of my heart ' â€” 'telas del corazon.'

Albarracin and came to Molina, to the Moor Abengalvon, who
received them with great joy, and on the morrow rode forth with
them with two hundred cavaliers, to escort them through the
forest of Luzon and Arbuxuelo, till they reached the Salon, fiut
the brothers, seeing the wealth the Moor carried, plotted treachery
together : ' If we could slay the Moor y^benga tagn, we might
possess ourselves of his wealth, and hold it as surely as our
possessions of Carrion ; and the Cid Campeador could never
have satisfaction of us.' But a Moor versed in Latin * overheard
the plot, and said to Abengalvon : ' Have a care, my lord. The
Infantes of Carrion plot thy death.' And Abengalvon was'very
wroth, and with his two hundred men he presented himself,
arms in hand, before the Infantes. ' Say, Infantes of Carrion,
what have I done to you ? Without guile am I serving you, and
ye plot my death. Were it not for my Cid of Bivar, I would
serve you so that the world should ring with it. I would
restore his daughters to the loyal Campeador, and ye should
never set foot in Carrion. Here I leave you as villains and
traitors. Under your favour. Ladies Elvira and Sol, I will
depart. God the Lord of the earth give the Campeador joy of
this marriage.' So saying the Moor returned across the Salon
towards Molina, and the Infantes moved forward and crossed
the Sierra of Miedes, and leaving Griza on the left arid San Es-
tdban on the right, but far beyond, they entered the oak wood of
Corpes,' â€” a tall forest, where branches lifted themselves to the
clouds, and fierce beasts roamed around. They found a glS3e\
with a clear fountain, and they caused the tents to be pitched,
and there they passed the night with their wives in their arms,
- making a show of love, which they ill proved at sunrise. Then
they ordered the mules to be loaded and their servants to go
forward, and when they four were left alone, then did the Infantes
do a cruel wrong. ' Here,' said they, ' in this wild forest, do we
cast you off, and the Cid Campeador shall know that this is our

/vengeance for the affair of the lion^' Then plucking off mantles
and pelisses, the cruel traitors strip them to their smocks and
undercoats, and seize the hard strong saddle-giiths. Seeing this,
said Dona Sol,' 'For God's sake we entreat you, as ye have
trenchant swords in your hands, rather cut off our heads, and
let us be martyrs. If we are beaten, ye will be reviled of
M oors and Christians, and called to answer it in Council or in

fCoites.' But all their entreaties availed them nothing, for

, straightway the Infantes began to lash them with the saddle-
jgirths and sharp spurs, tearing their linen and their flesh till the
bright blood ran down their clothing. ' Ah! ' thought the ladies
^their hearts, ' if it were God's will, what fortune it would be if
ijhe Campeador should now appear.' Then, weary of striking
and striving which could give the hardest blows, the Infentes left
ilvira and Sol for dead, a prey to the beasts and birds of the
forest. O for the Cid Campeador to come upon them that
liour ! Then the Infantes went on their way rejoicing through
ihfijfflod. [Now are we avenged of ou r ma rriages,' said they.
' Thusis^HSiB-dishoiiouc-of_theJ.ion avengedJ But I must tell

he followed the road, and/ he drew aside from the others, and
hid himself in a thicket t<i watch whether his cousins came, and
what the Infantes did. He saw them pass and heard their talk':

_bad they seen him, look you, he had not escaped death. But
they spurred onwards, and he turned back and found his cousins
in a swoon, and sprang from his horse, crying, ' Cousins ! cousins !

Dona Elvira and Dona Sol opened their eyes and saw Feliz
Muiioz, and in sore pain said Dona Sol : ' If our father the
Campeador deserve aught of you, for God's sake give us water.' â€¢
And with his hat (new and fresh was it when he brought it out
of Valencia) he fetched water and gave it to his cousins, and
urging them and encouraging them, he set them upon his horse,
and they took their way through the oak wood of Corpes, and by
nightfall they issued forth from the wood and reached the waters
of Duero. He left them at the Tower of Dona Urraca, and
came to San Est^ban, where he found Diego Tellez, kinsman



THE CID. 105

of Alvar Fanez. He, when he heard it, was grieved to the heart ;
and he took beasts and proper raiment, and fetched Dona Elvira
and Doiia Sol and lodged them in San Estdban, showing them .
all the honour he could. They of San Estdban are ever courteous,
and it grieved them to the heart when they knew of the matter,
and they comforted the daughters of the Cid and tended them
till they were restored. These tidings came to Valencia, and
when they were told to my Cid, he thought and pondered a
full hour : and he raised his hand and grasped his beard,
saying, ' Christ be thanked, since the Infantes of Carrion have
done me such honour. By this beard that none hath reaped^
the Infantes of Carrion shall not profit by this, and well shall I
marry my daughters.' And he ordered Minaya and Pero
Bermuez and Martin Antolinez to go with two hundred cavaliers
to bring back his daughters to Valencia. When Dona Elvira
and Doiia Sol saw Minaya, ' We are as thankful to see you,'
said they, ' as if we had seen the Creator ; and give ye thanks
unto him that we are alive. When we are on our journey, we
will tell you all our grievance.' And said Pero Bermuez, ' Be of
good cheer, since ye are alive and well and without other hurt.
Ye have lost a good marriage, but ye can win a better, and may
we see the day when we shall be able to avenge you.' And the
next day they set forth, they of San Estdban attending them
with loving kindness as far as the river-side.* And Minaya
and the ladies passed through Alcoceba to the right of San Es-
tdban de Gormaz and halted at the King's ford at the Casa de
Berlanga, and the next day they reached Medina, and the next
Molina. The Moor Abengalvon was glad, and went forth to

* ' Ffata rlo damor dando-Ies solaz.' M. Damas Hinard makes a
curious mistake here. He treats ' Rio Damor ' (so printed by Sanchez)
as a proper name, and says it is 'un petit ^ruisseau, affluent du Duero,
J. une lieue et demie de San Esteban. ' This is something like Warton's
interpretation of 'faucon brode' (i.e. a broad falchion) by 'falcon bird.'
â– 'Damor' is of course only 'deamor' â€” ' lovingly, ' or 'out of love.'
Nor is this his only contribution to Spanish topography. In a former
passage he explains ' la Foz ' by saying it is an affluent of the Jalon,
' Foz ' is nothing more than ' fossa,' the hollow in which the river
-runs, and ' foz ayuso ' is simply ' down the valley ' â€” (p. 71.)

receive them, and made them a rich supper for the love of the
Cid. Thence they went to Valencia, and he in the good hour
bom went forth to meet them, and he embraced them and
kissed them. ' Welcome, my daughters,' said he. ' God keep
you from evil. I accepted this marriage, for I dared not gajnsay
it. God grant that I see you .better married hereafter, and that
I have my revenge of my sons-in-law of Carrion.' Then he
took counsel with his followers, and he said to Mufio Gustioz,
f' Carry the tidings to Castile, to King Alfonso, of this dishonour
V the I nfantes have done me. It will cut the good king to the
heart, for he and not I gave my daughters in marriage, and if
any dishonour falls on us, great or small it falls on my lordf
Let him summon me the Infantes of Carrion to council, as-
sembly, or cortes, that I have justice of them, for heavy is the
grievance on my heart.' And Muiio Gustioz set forth, travelling
day and night, and found the king at Sahagun. And the king
was silent and meditated a good hour. ' Sooth to tell,' said he,
' it grieves me to the heart, for it was I married his daughters to
the Infantes of Carrion. I did it for his advantage, but to-day I
wish the match had not been made. It is his right that I
should aid him : so my heralds shzdl go through all my kingdom
^__summon my court to Toledo. And I shall summon the
Infantes of Carrion, that they do justice to my Cid the Cam-
peador, so that he have no grievance if I can prevent it. Tell
the Campeador to come to me to Toledo at the end of seven
Vweeks. For the love of him do I summon this court.' Then-
without delay Alfonso of Castile sent , letters to Leon and
Santiago, to the Portuguese and Galicians, and to them of
Carrion, and to the barons of Castile, that the honoured king
would hold a court in Toledo at the end of seven weeks, and
that he who came not to the court should not be esteemed his
vassal. It weighed heavily upon the Infantes of Carrion, for
they feared my Cid the Campeador would come ; and they
entreated the king to excuse them this court. ' That wiU I not
do,' said the king, ' so help me God : my Cid the Campeador
will come, and you have to render him justice, for he has a
grievance against you. He who will not come to my court, let
him quit my kingdom, for I relish him not.' Then the Infantes
saw there was no help for it, and they took counsel with their



THE CID. 10/

kinsmen ; and the Count Don Garcia, the enemy of my Cid, who
always sought to do him harm, was among them.

When the appointed day came, among the first went the
good King Don Alfonso, and the Count Don Anrrich, and the
Count Don Remond, the father of the good Emperor,* and the
Count Don Vella, and the Count Don Beltran, and many other
prudent men of the kingdom. With the Infantes were the Count
Don Garcfa, and Asur Gonzalez, and Gonzalo Asurez, and a
great band, which they brought to the court, thinking to overawe
my Cid. On the fifth day came my Cid (he had sent Alvar
Fanez before him), and when he saw the good King Alfonso, he
lighted down to humble himself and honour his lord. Said the
king, ' By San Esidro, I will have none of that. Mount, Cid !
With heart and soul I salute you. What grieves you, pains me
to the heart' That night my Cid did not cross the Tagus, but
lodged in San Servan,^ for he wished to watch and pray in that
sanctuary and commune -with Minaya and his trusty men.
When morning came he said to Minaya, ' Let a hundred of my
good men get ready, with vests under the hauberks bright as
the sun, and over the hauberks ermines and furs, the girdles
bound tight, so that the arms show not, and sweet trenchant
swords under the mantles. In this wise will I go to the court ^
to demand my rights and plead my plea, and, if the infantes of
Carrion try treachery, with a hundred such I shall have no fear.'
He himself put on breeches of fine cloth, and bravely wrought
shoes, and a linen shirt white as the sun, with loops of gold and
silver at the wrists, for so he would have it. And over that, and
under the surcoat, a tunic embroidered with gold, and next a

that title in 1135. Don Anrrich and Don Remorid were the Burgun-

the coiinty of Portugal. The latter married the Infanta Urraca, who
succeeded her father. Vide App. I.

robe of red fur with border of gold, which the Campeadof
always wore ; and over his hair a coif of rich scarlet worked '
with gold, for the hair of the good Campeador was not cut.
JLong was the beard he bore, and he bound it with a cord, so
I doing because he would fain preserve it ; and over all he threw
\a mantle of great price. Then mounting quickly, he issued forth
mSHrSan Servan, and thus arrayed did my Cid go to the court.
When they saw him enter, the good King Don Alfonso and the
"" Count Don Anrrich and the Count Don Remond, and all the
[others, irose to tjjeir feet. But the Crespo de Grafion ' would not
[_nse, nor they of the party of the Infantes of Carrion. My Cid
seated himself upon a couch, and the hundred who guarded him
placed themselves around him ; and all that were in the court
were gazing at my Cid and at the long beard he bore bound in
a cord. In his port he looked a triie baron, but for shame the
Infantes of Carrion could not look upon him. Then the king
rose to his feet. 'But two Cortes have I held since I have been
king, one in Burgos, the other in Carrion. This third have I
summoned to Toledo this day for the love of my Cid, him that
.was born in a good hour, that he have justice of the Infantes,
who, as we all know, have done him a wrong. Let the Count
Don Anrrich and the Count Don Remond and the other counts,
that are not of the party be judges in this matter ; and give ye
y^ur minds to it, to search out the right, for wrong I will not
have. Let us have peace on each side. I swear by San Esidro,
he who disturbs my court shall quit my kingdom and forfeit
my love, and he who shall prove his right, on his side am I.
Now let the Cid make his demanc|, and we will hesir what
answer the Infantes make.' My Cid kissed the king's hand and
rose^to his feet. ' Much do I thank you, my lord and king>^that
in love of me you have summoned this court. This do I

title of Count Garcia Ordonez ; but in the Cronica Rimada Count
Garci Femandes is called ' Crespo de Granon,' while Count Garcia de

rities the Cid's enemy was Count of Najera and Cabra, but Sandoval
seems to have some doubt whether the two titles belonged to the same
individual.

demand of the Infantes of Carrion. It is not I that am dis-
. honoured because they deserted my daughters, for it was you,
O king, who married them, and you will know what to do to-day.
But when they carried away my daughters from Valencia the
Great, I, of the love I bore them, gave them two swords that I
won in knightly fashion, Colada and Tizon, that with them they
might do honour to themselves and service to you. When they
deserted my daughters in the oak-wood of Corpes, they meant to
have nought of rhine. Let them restore my swords, since they
are no longer my sons-in-law.' And the judges agreed it was
just. Then said the Count Don Garcfa, 'We must speak about
this;' and going aside with their kinsmen, the Infantes said,
' Still does the Cid bear love to us, since he urges not against
us the dishonour of his daughters. Easily shall we reconcile
ourselves with the king. Let us give him his swords, since this
is the end of the dispute. When he has them, he will quit the
court.' And returning to the court they said, ' So please ye.
King Alfonso, we cannot deny that he gave us two swords, and
as he desires them, we give them up in your presence.' And
they drew forth the swords Colada and Tizon and placed them
in the hands of the king. And he drew the sWprds and dazzled
all the court ; of gold were the pummels- and guards. And all
that were in the court marvelled. The Cid, receiving the swords,,
held them in his hands, gazing on them. They could not change
them, for he knew them well. And his whole body was
glad, and from his heart he smiled, and grasping his beard, the
beard that none had reaped, 'Thus,' said he, 'are Dpfia Elvira
and Doiia Sol being avenged.' Then he called his nephew, and
stretching forfli his arm, gave him the sword Tizon. ' Take it,'
he said, ' and it will have a better master.' And to Martin
Antolinez, the worthy Burgalese, he gave the sword Colada.
' Take Colada,' he said : ' I won it from a brave master, the
Count Don Remont Berengel of Barcelona ; therefore do I give
it to you, that you take good care of it. I know if you have the
chance with it, you will win honour and glory.? Then he rose to
his feet., 'Thanks be to God and you, my lord the king, I am
satisfied in my swords, but I have another grievance against the
Infantes of Carrion. When they carried away my daughters
from Valencia, I gave them three thousand marks in gold and

silver. Let them restore my treasure, since they are no longer
iiiy sons-in-law.' Then made answer the Infantes, ' We gave
him back his swords, that he should make no further demand,
and that the dispute should end here. This, if it please the
king, is our answer.' But said the king, ' Ye must satisfy the
Cid in his demand.' With that the Infantes retired apart, per-
plexed in mind, for the sum was great and they had spent alL
'The conqueror of Valencia bears hard on us,' said they, 'in this
eagerness to seize our possessions. We must pay out of our
heritage in the lands of Carrion.' Said the judges, . ' If this
please the Cid we wiU not refuse it, but our judgment is that ye
make restitution here in the court.' Said Ferran Gonzalez,
'We have no money.' The Count Don Remond made answer,
'Ye have spent the gold and silver; then our award before King
Alfonso is that ye pay him in kind, and that the Campeador
accept it.' Then the Infantes saw there was no help, and you
might see them bring many a swift steed and stout mule and
trained palfrey, and good sword with its furniture. My Cid
received them on the appraising of the court, and the Infantes
paid him, borrowing of others, for their own means sufficed not.
Ill did they come, and scoffed at, look you, out of this debate.
My Cid received the appraisements, and his men took charge
of them ; but when this was done, they turned to another matter.



' So please your Grace ! once more upon your clemency I

call;
A grievance yet remains untold, the greatest grief of all.
And let the court give ear, and weigh the wrong that hath

been done.
I hold myself dishonoured by the Lords of Carrion.
Redress by combat they must yield; none other will I take.
How now, Infantes ! what excuse, what answer do ye make ?
Why have ye laid my heartstrings bare ? In jest or earnest,

say,
Have I offended you? and I will make amends to-day.

My daughters in your hands I placed the day that forth ye

went,
And rich in wealth and honours from Valencia were ye sent.

Why tear their flesh in Corpes wood with saddle-girths and

spurs.
And leave them to the beasts of prey ? Villains throughout

were ye !
What answer ye can make to this 'tis for the court to see.'
The Count Garcia was the first that rose to make reply.
' So please ye, gracious king, of all the Kings of Spain most

high;
Strange is the guise in which my Cid before you hath

appeared ;
To grace your summoned court he comes, with that long

straggling beard ;
With awe struck dumb, methinks, are some ; some look as

though they feared.
The noble Lords of Carrion of princely race are born;
To take the daughters of my Cid for lemans they should

scorn ;
Much more for brides of equal birth: in casting them

aside â€”
We care not for his blustering talk â€” we hold them justified.'
Upstood the Champion, stroked his beard,, and grasped it

in his hands.
' Thanks be to God above,' he cried, ' who heaven and

earth commands,
A long and lordly gro^\'th it is, my pleasure and my pride j

Its nurture since it graced my chin hath ever been my care ;
No son of woman born hath dared to lay a finger there ;
No son of Christian or of Moor hath ever plucked a hair.
Remember Cabra, Count ! of thine the same thou canst not

say :
On both thy castle and thy beard I laid my hand that day :
Nay ! not a groom was there but he his handful plucked

away.
Look, where my hand hath been, my lords, all ragged yet it

grows ! '
With noisy protest breaking in Ferran Gonzalez rose :
'"â– Cid, let there be an end of this ; your gifts you have again,
And now no pretext for dispute between us doth remain.
Princes of Carrion are we, with fitting brides we mate ;
Daughters of emperors or kings, not squires of low estate :
We brook not such alliances, and yours we rightly spumed.'
My Cid, Ruy Diaz, at the word, quick, to Bermuez turned.
'Now is the tiine. Dumb Peter,* speak, O man that sittest

mute !
My daughters' and thy cousins' name and fame are in

dispute :
To me they speak, to thee they look to answer every word.
If I am left to answer now, thou canst not draw thy sword.'
Tongue-tied Bermuez stood, awhile he strove for words in

vain,
But, look you, when he once began he made his haeaning

plain.

It never was a gift of mine, and that long gfnce you

knew ;
But have you found me fail in aught that fell to me to do ?
You lie, Ferrando ; lie in all you say upon that score.
The honour was to you, not him, the Cid Campeador ;
For I know something of your worth, and somewhat I can

tell.
That day beneath Valencia wall â€” ^you recollect it well â€”
You prayed the Cid to place you in the forefront of the

fray;
You spied a Moor, and valiantly you went that Moor to

slay ;
Arid then you turned and fled â€” for his approach you would

not stay.
Right soon he would -have taught you 'twas a sorry game to

play.
Had I not been in battle there to take your place that day.
I slew him at the first onfall ; I gave his steed to you ;
To no man have I told the tale from that hour hitherto.
Before my Cid and all his men you got yourself a name.
How you in single combat slew a Moor â€” a deed of fame ;
And all believed in your exploit : they wist not of your

shame.
You are a craven at the core ; tall, handsome, as you

stand :
How dare you talk as now you talk, you tongue without a

hand? 9
Again,""Ferran(io, call to mind â€” another tale for you â€”
That matter of the lion ; it was at Valencia too.

114 THE CID.

f My Cid lay sleeping when you saw the unchained lion near ; ,

What did you do, Ferrando, then, in your agony of fear?

Low did you crouch behind the couch whereon the Cham-
pion lay :

You did, Ferrando, and by that we rate your worth to-day.

We gathered round to guard our lord, Valencia's conqueror.

He rose, and to the lion went, the brave Campeador ;

The lion fawned before his feet and let him grasp its mane ;

He thrust it back into the cage I he turned to us again :

His trusty vassals to a man he saw around him there :

Where were his sons-in-law? he asked, and none could tell
him where./^

Now take thou my defiance as a traitor, trothless knight :

Upon this plea before our King Alfonso will I fight ;

The daughters of my lord are wronged, their wrong is mine
to right.

That ye those ladies did desert, the baser are ye then ;

For what are they? â€” weak women; and what are ye?â€”
strong men.

On every count I deem their cause to be the holier,

And I will make thee own it when we meet in battle here.

Traitor thou shalt confess thyself, so help me God on high,

Ajid all that I have said to-day my sword shall verify.'
/ ^hus far these two. Diego rose, and spoke as ye shall hear :

' Counts by our birth are we, of stain our lineage is clear.

In this alliance with my Cid there was no parity.

If we his daughters cast aside, no cause for shame we see.

And little need we care if they in mourning pass their lives,

\ Enduring the reproach that cUngs to scorned rejected wives.
In leaving them we but upheld our honour and our right,
And ready to the death am I, maintaining this, to fight.'

Here Martin Antolinez sprang upon his feet : 'False hound !

Will you not silent keep that mouth where truth was never
found ?

For you to boast ! the lion scare have you forgotten too ?

How through the open door you rushed, across the court-
yard flewj

How sprawling in your terror on the wine-press beam you
lay?

Ay ! never more, I trow, you wore the mantle of that day.'

There is no choice ; the issue now the sword alone can try ;

The daughters of my Cid ye spurned ; that must ye justify.

On every count I here declare their cause the cause of
right,

And thou shalt own thy treachery the day we join in fight.'

He ceased, and striding up the hall Assur Gonzalez passed ;

His cheek was flushed with wine, for he had stayed to
break his fast ;

Ungirt his robe, and trailing low his ermine mantle hung ;

Rude was his bearing to the Court, and reckless was his
tongue.

' What a to-do is here, my lords ! was the like ever seen ?

What talk is this about my Cid â€” ^him of Bivar I mean ?

To Riodouima let him go to take his millers' rent.

And keep his mills agoing there,^ as once he was content.

' Frere translates this : ' For shame, never wear a mantle nor a
knightly robe again.'

" Frere translates : ' Has he been to Riodivirna to besiege the
windmills there ? ' Seeing that the mills (not wind- but water-mills)
were his own, the Cid was not likely to besiege them. 'Molino picar '
is simply to work a mill. Riodouima is now the Rio Oviema, which
flows past Bivar.

prayer,
Whose heart is plotting mischief when thy lips are speaking

Whose plighted word to friend or lord hath ever proved a

lie J
False always to thy fellow-man, falser to God on high.
No share in thy good will I seek ; one only boon I pray,
The chance to make thee own thyself the villain that I say.'
Then spoke the king : 'Enough of words : ye have my

leave to fight.
The challenged and the challengers ; and God defend the

right.'



/ But lo ! two cavaliers came into court ; one, Oiarra by name,
the other Yeneg^o Simenez ; the one the Infante of Navarre,
the other the Infante of Aragon.' They kiss King Alfonso's
hand, and ask the daughters of my Cid the Carapeador for
Queens of Navarre and Aragon ; whereat the Court was silent
*^aad^ave ear. My Cid rose to his feet. ' So please your grace,
King Alfonso, for this do I thank the Creator, that from Navarre
and Aragon they ask them of me. You gave them in marriage
before, not I. My daughters are in your hands. Without
your command, I will do nothing.' The king rose and bade
the Court keep silence. ' Of you, Cid, noble Campeador, I ask
consent that this marriage be ratified to-day in this court, for
it brings to you honour and territory.' Said my Cid : ' Since it
is pleasing to you, I agree to it.' Then said the king, ' I' ratify

Oiarra and Inigo Simenez are, of course, the names of the envoys.

this marriage of the daughters of my Cid, Doiia Elvira and
Dona Sol, with the Infantes of Navarre and Aragon. Let this
debate end ; and to-morrow, at the rising of the sun, shall be the
combat, three against three, of those engaged by challenge in
the court.' But said the Infantes of Carrion hastily : ' Grant us
time, O king, for to-morrow it cannot be : they of the Cam-
peador have arms and horses, but we must first go to our
domains of Carrion.' Said the king to the Campeador, ' This
combat shall be vyhen you command.' But said my Cid, ' I will
take no part in it. I love Valencia more than the lands of
Carrion.' Then said the king : ' Campeador, leave your
cavaliers and arms with me, fearing nothing. I will take care, as
vassal would for his lord, that neither of count nor squire they
suffer violence, and at the end of three weeks they shall engage
in this combat in the vega of Carrion in my presence. He who
appears not at the expiration of the time, shall lose his cause, be
held vanquished, and pass for a traitor.' My Cid kissed the
king's hand and said, ' I am content, my lord : my three gentle-
men are in your hands : they are ready to do their duty. Send
them to me to Valencia with honour, for the love of the Creator.'
Then the Campeador took off his coif, and removed the cord
and released his beard ; nor could all they that were in the court
refrain from gazing on him. And he approached the Counts
Don Anrrich and Don Remond, and embraced them, entreatiiig
them to take what they pleased of his wealth â€” them and the
others that were well disposed. And some there were who took
and some not. Then my Cid kissed the king's hand, and
moved towards his horse. Said he, ' You bid me mount the
courser Babieca. Among Moors or Christians there is not such
another to-day. As a gift I give him to you ; deign to accept
him, my lord.' ' That will I not,' said the king. ' If I took
him from you, the horse would not have so good a lord. A
horse like that is for the like of you, to beat the Moors off the
field and press them in pursuit. God speed not the man who
would take him from you, for by you and your steed do we
gain honour.' And the Campeador laid charge on them who
were to fight. ' Martin Antolinez, and you; Pero Bermuez, and
Muiio Gustioz, bear yourselves stoutly on the field like men, that
good news of you come to me in Valencia.' Said Martin



Ii8 THE CID.

Antolinez, ' Why say that, my lord ? We have accepted the
duty, and' it is for us to go through with it. You may hear of
us dead, but not conquered.' Glad at this was he in the good
hour born ; and so my Cid departed for Valencia and the king^
for Carrion.

And now the three weeks of truce were passed, and the
champions of the Campeador were ready to do their lord's
behest. Two days they waited for the Infantes of Carrion ; who
came well provided with horses and arms, apd with them all
their kinsmen, so that, if haply they could separate the Cid's
chanipions, they might slay them to the dishonour of their lord.
Evil was the ydesign, but it wa s not attempted, for they were in
great fear offelfonso.flÂ£Leon^ Through the night they watched
their arms anSprayed. ^^Een the night was passed and the
dawn broke, there came a multitude of men of substance, eager
to see the fight

They of the Campeador donned their armour all together,
being all of one lord. And, on the other side, the Infantes armed
themselves, the Count Garcfa Ordonez giving them counsel.
And they pleaded with- King Alfonso that the trenchant
swords Colada and Tizon should not be used in battle, and that
the Campeador's champions Â«hould not fight with them. Sorely
did the Infantes repent that they had restored them. So said
they to the king, but he gave them no comfort. ' Had ye not
swords with you when we held the Court ? Wield them well, and
they will serve your needs, and suffice against those of Cam-
peador. Arise, and go to the field, Infantes of Carrion. Ye have
need to fight like men, for there will be no shortcoming on the
side of the Campeador. If ye come well out of the field, ye will
have great honour : if ye are vanquished, ye cannot charge it to
us, for all know it was your own seeking.' Then did the Infantes
of Carrion Jiggent of what they had done : for all Carrion they
would not have done it. They of the Campeador all three were
armed, and King Alfonso went to see them. ' We kiss your
hands as our king and lord,' they said. ' Be just to them and to
us to-day, and aid us in the right, not in the wrong. The
Infantes have their faction here ; we know not what they wiU do,
but our lord put us in your hand. Then hold to the right, for the
love of the Creator.' Then they led them forth their horses, strong

and swift; they signed the cross upon their saddles, and mounted
stoutly, their well-bossed shields about their necks, and their
pennoned lances with trenchant blades in their hands. So they
went forth to the plain where the bounds were set, all three agreed
to strike well home each at his man. On the other side came
the Infantes of Carrion, well attended, for their kinsmen werf
many. The king assigned them marshals to decide the right
and wrong, so that there should be no dispute, and from his seat
upon the field said King Alfonso : 'Hear what I say, Infantes of
Carrion. This combat ye should have fought at Toledo ; but ye
would not : so I have brought these three cavaliers of my Cid
in safety to the lands of Carrion. Take your right, seek no
wrong : who attempts it, ill betide him.' Then the marshals
and the king mark out the bounds, and to all the six they
point out that he who should pass the bound should be held
vanquished : and all the people withdraw six lance-lengths,
and they portion out the field and the sun for them by lot.



The marshals leave them face to face and from the lists are
gone ; *

Here stand the champions of my Cid, there those of
.Carrion ;

Each with his gaze intent and fixed upon his chosen
foe,

Their bucklers braced before their breasts, their lances
pointing low.

Their heads bent down, as each man leans above his saddle-
bow.

Then with one impulse every spur is in the charger's side,

And earth itself is felt to shake beneath their furious
stride ;

* Ticknor points out the resemblance between this passage and the
description of the combat between Palamon and Arcite in Chaucer's
KnigMs Tale.

Till, midway meeting, three with three, in struggle fierce'

they lock, , '

While all account them dead who hear the echo of the

shock.
Ferrando and his challenger, Pero Bermuez, close ;
Firm are the lances held, and fair the shields receive the

blows.
Through Pero's shield Ferrando drove his lance, a bloodless

stroke ;
The point stopped short in empty space, the shaft in

splinters broke.
But on Bermuez, firm of seat, the shock fell all in vain ;
And while he took Ferrando's thrust he paid it back again.
The armoured buckler shattering, right home his lance he

pressed.
Driving the point through boss and plate against his foe-
man's breast.
Three folds of mail Ferrando wore,^ they stood him in good

stead ;
Two yielded to the lance's point, the third held fast the headt
But forced into the flesh it sank a hand's-breadth deep or

more,
Till bursting from the gasping lips in torrents gushed the

gore.
Then, the girths breaking, o'er the croup borne rudely to

the ground,

He lay, a dying man it seemed to all who stood around.

Â° This is translated by Frere : ' Two breastplates Fernando wore
and a coat of mail.' Why, it would be hard to say ; for the original is
plain enough, ' tres dobles de loriga tenie Fernando. ' Furthermore, a
knight in plate armour at this period is an anachronism. In an earlier
passage, too, he translates 'loriga ' by 'breastplates.'

Bermuez cast his lance aside, and sword in hand came on ;
Ferrando saw the blade he bore, he knew it was Tizon :
Quick ere the dreaded brand could fall, ' I yield me,' came

the cry.
Vanquished the marshals granted him, and Pero let him lie.

And Martin Antolinez and Diegoâ€” fair and true
Each struck upon the other's shield, and wide the splinters

flew.
Then Antolinez seized his sword, and as he drew the blade,
A dazzhng gleam of burnished steel across the meado\<r

played";
And at Diego striking full, athw;art the helmet's crown.
Sheer through the steel plates of the casque he drove the

falchion down.
Through coif and scarf, till from the scalp the locks it razed

away,
And half shorn off and half upheld the shattered head-piece

Jay.
Reeling beneath the blow that proved Colada's cruel might,
Diego saw no charfce but one, no safety save in flight :
He wheeled and fled, but close behind bim Antolinez dfew ;
With the flat blade a hasty blow he dealt him as he flew ; .
But idle, was Diego's sword ; he shrieked to Heaven for aid :
,' O God of glory,- give me help 1 save me from yonder-
blade ! '
Unreined, his good steed bore him safe and swept him past

the bound.
And Martin Antolinez stood alone upon tjie groiifld.
' Come hither,' said the king ; ' thus far the conquerors are

ye.'
And fairly fought and won the field the marshals both- agree.

So much for these, and how they fought : remains to tell

you yet
How meanwhile Muno Gustioz Assur Gonzalez met.
With a strong arm and steady aim each struck the other's
.â–  'â–  shield,

And under Assur's sturdy thrust the plates of Muno's yield ;
But harmless passed the lance's point, and spent its force in

air.
Not so Don Muno's ; on the shield of Assur striking fair,
Through plate and boss and foeman's breast his pennoned

â€¢ lance he sent.
Till out between the shoulder blades a fathom's length it

went." '
Then, as the lance he plucked away, clear from the saddle

swung,
With one strong wreBclt of Muno's wrist to earth was

Assur flung ; ,
And back it came, shaft, pennon, blade, all stained a gory

red;
Nor was there one of all the crowd but counted Assur sped,
While o'er him Muao Gustioz stood with uplifted brand.
Then cried Gonzalo Assurez : ' In God's name hold thy

hand !
Already have ye won the field ; iko more is needed now.'
And said the marshals, ' It is just, and we the claim allow.'



' 'Una braza,' which exactly -corresponds with our fathom, being
the length of the extended arms from finger tip to finger tip. A man
through whom that length of lance had been driven and withdrawn
would not, according to modern notions, need intercession on his
behalf, but, as the reader has probably noticed, the heroes of the
Poema del Cid have a Homeric capacity for cold steel.

And then the King Alfonso gave command to clear the

ground,
And gather in the relics of the battle strewed around.
And from the 'field in honour went Don Roderick's chain-

pions three. .
Thanks be to God, the Lord of all, that gave the victory.

-But fearing treachery, that night upon their way they went,
As King Alfonso's honoured guests in safety, homeward

sent.
And to Valencia city day and night they journeyed oh.
To tell my Cid Campeador that his behest was done.
But in th6 lands of Carrion it was a day of woe,^
And on the lords 6f Carrion it fell a heravy blow.
He who a noble lady wrongs and casts aside â€” may he
Meet like requital for his deeds, or worse, if worse there be.-
But let us leave them where they lieâ€” their meed is all

men's scorn. ' ' ,â€¢

Turn we to speak' of him that in a happy hour was born.
Valencia the Great was glad, rejoiced at heart to see /

The honoured champion? of her lord return in victory :
And RuyDiaz grasped his beard :' Thanks be to God,'

said Tie,
* Of part or lot in Carrion now are my daughters free ; _
Now may I give them without shame whoe'er the suitors be.'
And favoured by the king himself, Alfonso of Leon,
Prosperous was the wooing of Navar re and Ara gon.
The bridals of Elvira and of Sol in splendour passed ;
Stately the former nuptials were, but statelier far the last.

And he that in a good hour was bOrn, behold how he hath

' sped !
His daughters now to higher rank and greater honour wed :
Sought by Navarre and Aragon for queens his daughters

twain ; '

And mondrchs of his blood to-day upon the thrones of

Spain.
And so his honour in the land grows greater day by day.
Uponthe feast of Pentecost from life he passed away.
For him and all of us the Grace of Christ let us implore.
And here ye have 'Ca.t story of my Cid Campeador.*

'â€¢ ' Estas son las nuevas de myo Cid el Campeador.'

The Bivar MS. concludes with the lines quoted in the introduction,
p. 7, to which is added the distichâ€”

' dat nos del vino si non tenedes dimieros,

'Ca mas podre, que bien vos lo dixieron labielos.'

This probably was. a customary ' tag ' addressed by the minstrel or
jongleur td his audience at the conclusion of his recitation or chant.
FroHLother poems of the period it would appear that a cup of wine
was a common honorarium.
