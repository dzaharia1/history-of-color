    Gilgamish arose interpreting dreams,
    addressing his mother.
    "My mother! during my night
    I, having become lusty, wandered about
    in the midst of omens.
    And there came out stars in the heavens,
    Like a ... of heaven he fell upon me.
    I bore him but he was too heavy for me.
    He bore a net but I was not able to bear it.
    I summoned the land to assemble unto him,
    that heroes might kiss his feet.
    He stood up before me [55]
    and they stood over against me.
    I lifted him and carried him away unto thee."
    The mother of Gilgamish she that knows all things,
    said unto Gilgamish:--
    "Truly oh Gilgamish he is
    born [56] in the fields like thee.
    The mountains have reared him.
    Thou beholdest him and art distracted(?)
    Heroes kiss _his_ feet.
    Thou shalt spare him....
    Thou shalt lead him to me."
    Again he dreamed and saw another dream
    and reported it unto his mother.
    "My mother, I have seen another
    [dream. I beheld] my likeness in the street.
    In Erech of the wide spaces [57]
    he hurled the axe,
    and they assembled about him.
    Another axe seemed his visage.
    I saw him and was astounded.
    I loved him as a woman,
    falling upon him in embrace.
    I took him and made him
    my brother."
    The mother of Gilgamish she that knows all things
    [said unto Gilgamish:--]

    that he may join with thee in endeavor."
    (Thus) Gilgamish solves (his) dream.
    Enkidu sitting before the hierodule

    [   ] forgot where he was born.
    Six days and seven nights
    came forth Enkidu
    and cohabited with the courtesan.
    The hierodule opened her mouth
    speaking unto Enkidu.
    "I behold thee Enkidu; like a god thou art.
    Why with the animals
    wanderest thou on the plain?
    Come! I will lead thee
    into the midst of Erech of the wide places,
    even unto the holy house, dwelling place of Anu.
    Oh Enkidu, arise, I will conduct thee
    unto Eanna dwelling place of Anu,
    where Gilgamish [_oppresses_] the souls of men(?)
    And as I ............
    thou shalt ........ thyself.
    Come thou, arise from the ground
    unto the place yonder (?) of the shepherd."
    He heard her speak and accepted her words with favor.
    The advice of the woman
    fell upon his heart.
    She tore off one garment
    and clothed him with it.
    With a second garment
    she clothed herself.
    She clasped his hand,
    guiding him like ..............
    unto the mighty presence of the shepherd,
    unto the place of the ... of the sheepfolds.

    Milk of the cattle
    he drank.
    Food they placed before him.
    He broke bread [58]
    gazing and looking.
    But Enkidu understood not.
    Bread to eat,
    beer to drink,
    he had not been taught.
    The hierodule opened her mouth
    and said unto Enkidu:--
    "Eat bread, oh Enkidu!
    It is the conformity of life,
    of the conditions and the fate of the land."
    Enkidu ate bread,
    until he was satiated.
    Beer he drank
    seven _times_(?).
    His thoughts became unbounded and he shouted loudly.
    His heart became joyful,
    and his face glowed.
    He stroked.................
    _the hair of the head_. [59] His body
    with oil he anointed.
    He became like a man.
    He attired himself with clothes
    even as does a husband.
    He seized his weapon,
    which the panther and lion
    fells in the night time cruelly.
    He captured the wild mountain goats.
    The panther he conquered.
    Among the great _sheep for sacrifice_
    Enkidu was their guard.
    A man, a leader,
    A hero.

    And he made glad.
    He lifted up his eyes,
    and beheld the man,
    and said unto the hierodule:--
    "Oh harlot, take away the man.
    Wherefore did he come to me?
    I would forget the memory of him."
    The hierodule called unto the man
    and came unto him beholding him.
    She sorrowed and was astonished
    how his ways were ............
    Behold she opened her mouth
    saying unto Enkidu:--
    "At home with a family [_to dwell_??]
    is the fate of mankind.
    Thou shouldest design boundaries(??)
    for a city. The trencher-basket put (upon thy head).
    ....  ......an abode of comfort.

    Unto Gilgamish king of Erech of the wide places

    as unto a husband.
    He cohabits with the wife decreed for him,
    even he formerly.
    But henceforth
    in the counsel which god has spoken,
    in the work of his presence
    shall be his fate."
    At the mention of the hero
    his face became pale.

    The artisans gathered about him.

    the people assembled
    disputing round about him:--

    Milk of the cattle

    A project was instituted.

    Gilgamish and Enkidu
    grappled with each other,
    goring like an ox.
    The threshold they destroyed.
    The wall they demolished.
    Gilgamish bowed
    to the ground at his feet
    and his javelin reposed.
    He turned back his breast.
    After he had turned back his breast,
    Enkidu unto that one
    spoke, even unto Gilgamish.
    "Even as one [60] did thy mother
    bear thee,
    she the wild cow of the cattle stalls,
    Ninsunna,
    whose head she exalted more than a husband.
    Royal power over the people
    Enlil has decreed for thee."
